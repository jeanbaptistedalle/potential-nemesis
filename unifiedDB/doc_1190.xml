<HEAD>Energy Futures Surge as Cold Weather Continues</HEAD>

   Continued cold weather in the eastern half of
the nation boosted energy futures sharply higher Thursday.
   Home heating oil for January delivery shot up 4.05 cents to
79.81 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Subsequent contract months also posted strong gains.
   Demand for heating oil has surged as temperatures plunged in
recent days. Several oil companies _ including Exxon USA, Mobil
Corp. and Texaco Inc.'s Star Enterprise _ have reported temporary
shortages of the fuel at some of their Northeast terminals.
   James Fiedler, an oil market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the cold was responsible not only
for the jump in heating oil prices, but in gasoline futures as well.
   Unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 2.41 cents to 55.63
cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange, with later months also
rising sharply.
   Fiedler said traders were anticipating weather-related problems
at gasoline refineries in Texas, where freezing temperatures have
forced plant shutdowns in previous years. Refinery closings could
make gasoline supplies tighter.
   Crude oil prices, which often rise along with refined product
prices, continued that trend Thursday. West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 31 cents to settle at $21.52 a
42-gallon barrel.
