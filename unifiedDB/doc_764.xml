   Judith Jamison, a former dancer in the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater who left to work on Broadway and form
her own group, was named Wednesday as Ailey's successor as artistic
director of the company.
   Ailey, who founded the dance company 31 years ago, died Dec. 1.
   Miss Jamison said at a news conference at the company's school
that, earlier this year, Ailey told her he wanted her to succeed
him. ``He said, `You're going in another direction now.'''
   ``It's like coming home to a place I've been in my heart for
years, even if I haven't been here physically,'' she said.
   Miss Jamison joined the company in 1965, leaving 15 years later
to be one of the stars of ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies''
on Broadway.
   Last year, she started the Jamison Project, for which she
choreographs and dances. The Jamison Project will continue through
June and some dancers and some dance works will enter the Ailey
company.
   The future of the Ailey company, Miss Jamison said, ``will
reflect his vision and mine. They're not one and the same.'' She
said changes will be ``a creative process we will be working on the
entire time I'm here.''
   ``Mr. Ailey's original idea was of having a family of dancers
who care that they're dancing, who remember where that blessing,
that talent, comes from, and want to share that with an audience.
So I would just like to continue that.''
   The Ailey company's New York season runs until Dec. 31. It will
tour in the United States in the spring, then perform in Singapore
in June and in three cities in the Soviet Union in September.
