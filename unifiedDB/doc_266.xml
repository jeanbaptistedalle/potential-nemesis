<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday signed a bill giving
thousands of immigrant nurses the right to apply for status as
permanent residents of the United States.
   The bill exempts nurses from the ceilings on visa allotments
because of the nursing shortage.
   The bill covers nurses from other countries who can prove they
were employed as nurses in the United States for at least three
years, and are stil working as nurses.
   Most immigrant nurses held visas permitting them to stay in the
United States for five years, and then they had to return home.
   In congressional tetsimony this summer, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service estimated that 16,000 nurses held visas that
were on the brink of expiring.
