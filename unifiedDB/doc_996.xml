   The Justice Department set up a hot line today
to collect tips from callers who may have information on the
whereabouts of deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The Bush administration is offering a $1 million reward for
information leading to the capture of Noriega, who is wanted by
federal authorities on drug trafficking charges.
   The line was set up after the White House and the Justice
Department received calls from people offering information about
Noriega, who has been missing since U.S. forces invaded Panama
early Tuesday, said department spokesman David Runkel.
   Information taken from people who call the number will be
forwarded to U.S. officials in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama
City is collecting tips from Panamanians, Runkel said.
   Runkel cited a number of calls already received when asked if he
thought the Justice Department realistically expected to get useful
information about Noriega from people in this country.
   The spokesman said he couldn't say whether the tips in hand
contained specific, credible or even useful information.
   One of the stated purposes of the invasion was to capture
Noriega, but he has so far eluded capture.
   The hot line number is 202-633-1000.
