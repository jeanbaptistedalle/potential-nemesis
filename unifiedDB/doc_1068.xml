   President Bush gave a light-hearted account
Thursday of a ``catastrophic ice-skating accident'' in which his
13-year-old grandson ``bit the dust.''
   Young George P. Bush said later he had five stitches in his chin
after the accident at a public skating rink about two blocks from
the White House.
   The president also was ailing.
   ``I have a pain in the neck _ seriously,'' Bush told reporters
during an afternoon news conference.
   The president clearly had trouble moving his head, and White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush got a stiff neck
while lying on a couch Thursday morning reading an intelligence
report. Fitzwater said a doctor gave Bush some medication, which he
declined to identify.
   Bush described his grandson's mishap as he explained the absence
of his wife, Barbara, at a ceremony commemorating the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah.
   ``She started to walk over here. Then there was this
catastrophic ice-skating accident in which one of our grandchildren
bit the dust. He's now getting a stitch put in his lip,'' the
president said.
   ``Life goes on,'' Bush added.
   Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush, said the youth was
getting five or six stitches in his chin, not his lip. He was
treated by the White House physician, Dr. Burton Lee, she said.
   The youngster is the son of John and Columba Bush.
