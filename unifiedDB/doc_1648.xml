   A man convicted of trying to smuggle
foreign currency was sentenced to death Sunday by a military court.
   Sudan Airways pilot Girgis Butrus, who will be hanged, was
convicted Saturday by the special military tribunal of trying to
smuggle more than $100,000 worth of foreign currency out of Sudan.
   The court said he was guilty of ``subversion of the Sudanese
economy,'' a crime punishable by death under laws in effect since a
military coup overthrew the civilian government June 30.
   The tribunal sentenced Mohamed al-Rashid, a driver at Khartoum
airport, to 10 years in jail after convicting him of helping Butrus.
   Earlier this month, the military government hanged one man
convicted of dealing in the foreign currency black market and
another for selling drugs.
   Two other Sudanese are on death row, one for dealing in the
foreign currency and another for leading a one-week strike by
doctors.
   The United States has strongly condemned the death sentences.
