   Government security officers said Monday they
are increasingly worried that violence will break out at detention
centers filled with Vietnamese protesting their forced repatriation.
   The daily demonstrations, which started when 51 people were sent
back to Vietnam on Dec. 12, continued Monday with thousands of
Vietnamese marching and staging sit-ins at three detention centers
in this British colony.
   The protests have been peaceful, although prison officers were
threatened Sunday by Vietnamese wielding homemade weapons at one
camp.
   Junior officers of the Corrections Services Department, which
runs the camps, said they feared for their lives because of the
growing numbers of weapons being uncovered, the government-run
radio reported.
   They also said the demonstrations increased worries the weapons
would be used against prison officers and urged the government to
fill hundreds of staff vacancies to increase security.
   Robert Van Leeuwen, the head of the local office of the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said he did not believe the
forced repatriation would greatly deter more Vietnamese from
sailing to Hong Kong from their Communist homeland.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese are languishing in camps in Hong Kong.
About 12,000 who arrived before June 1988 are considered refugees
eligible for resettlement abroad. The rest arrived after a new
screening program took effect and face repatriation to Vietnam
unless they can prove they fled persecution.
   Van Leeuwen has said forced repatriation is premature and
efforts should concentrate on the U.N.-monitored program of sending
home Vietnamese who volunteer to go back.
