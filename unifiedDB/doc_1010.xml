   A 52-pound turkey once bound for a
Christmas banquet table is pecking away in a back yard because an
animal control officer didn't have the heart to wring its neck.
   The turkey was found waddling the streets this week and senior
animal control Officer John Gonzales initially hoped to donate it
to a group that feeds the homeless.
   ``Everyone was interested in getting a turkey that large, but no
one wanted him alive,'' he said. But no one wanted to kill the
bird, especially not Gonzales.
   So he turned to Beach Charities, a non-profit group that
sponsors a Christmas Adopt-a-Pet program.
   Sharrie Dyer, director of Beach Charities, said she liked the
idea of donating a big turkey to feed the homeless. But she hated
the idea of playing benefactor and butcher.
   ``After all,'' she said, ``our mascot is a 7-foot pelican, Long
Beak. How would it look for Long Beak to kill a turkey?''
   So she bought 20 lifeless turkeys for the Christmas dinners of
needy families.
   And animal control Officers Donna and Paul Clement adopted the
gobbler and added him to their menagerie on their ranch near Corona.
   His name?
   ``Lotto, of course,'' said Gonzales. ``Because he's so lucky to
be alive.''
