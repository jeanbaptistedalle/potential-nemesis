<HEAD>US Says Nicaraguan Action on Supply Flight is Unfortunate</HEAD>

   The State Department on Thursday said
Nicaragua was citing specious reasons for delaying the monthly U.S.
flight carrying supplies for the American Embassy in Managua.
   The Sandinista government took the action on Wednesday after
complaining that U.S. forces blocked the departure of two
Nicaraguan planes parked at the airport in Panama City.
   State Department press officer Adam Shub said the Nicaraguan
planes have been unable to leave because of limited capacity at the
airport, a problem that has affected other aircraft as well. He
said the problem is expected to be resolved shortly.
   ``It is unfortunate that the Sandinistas, who say they want
better relations with the United States, have chosen to make this a
political issue by delaying our embassy's monthly C-130 supply
flight,'' he said.
   He added that Nicaragua knows full well the circumstances at the
airport in Panama City.
   ``If the Sandinistas are sincere about wanting better relations
with the U.S. and their neighbors, they should stop raising such
specious issues,'' Shub said.
   The next monthly supply flight to Managua is scheduled for Jan.
11.
