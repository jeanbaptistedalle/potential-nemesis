   When the Rev. C. Michael Thornburg,
Anglican scholar and rector of Christ Church, turned to his
ultimate boss with a plea for help out of a financial bind, he
didn't expect such a quick respone.
   Thornburg said he prayed, ``You got me into this, now get me
out.''
   Thirty minutes later, Harold D. Hayes, one of the contractors
who provides bus service for the Southern Berkshire Regional School
District knocked on the rectory door and a second career was born.
   Twice each school day Thornburg takes the wheel of a big yellow
school bus in this little Berkshire Hills town.
   ``This has turned out to be one of the best parts of being in
Sheffield,'' he said recently.
   He described his unusual second job as the answer to his prayers
on how to to keep three chldren in college on a clergyman's
stipend. Thornburg, armed with a B.A., an M.A., a divinity degree
and a Ph.D., hired on to drive 55 children grades K-12 over the
rural New England hills.
   The expert on the history of the Anglican Church and the
Reformation sees it as a challenge that goes beyond keeping an
close eye on icy roads.
   ``I'm the first adult the children see outside their homes each
morning,'' he said. ``I affect in some small way how they feel
about themselves entering the day.''
   Of course, he said. ``I don't hesitate to yell at them and tell
them to sit down.''
