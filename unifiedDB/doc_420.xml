   A businessman caught driving 75 mph in
a 50-mph zone has been fined a record $11,400, the Ilta-Sanomat
newspaper reported today.
   Speeding fines are based on the offender's annual income. But
the managing director, who was not identified further, told police
when he was stopped in August that he had no fixed income.
   After checking with local authorities, police were told he
grossed $300,000 in 1987, the report said.
   The businessman lost an appeal when authorities confirmed his
1988 income also had been more than $300,000, excluding property
worth millions, Ilta-Sanomat said.
