   A storm with high winds and
torrential rains swept through the Brisbane area on Sunday, killing
one person, damaging homes, uprooting trees and leaving 45,000
homes without power.
   In some southern suburbs of the city in eastern Australia, three
inches of rain fell in 15 minutes, police said.
   An unidentified woman died when her boat overturned off Bribie
Island, 35 miles north of Brisbane. Her body was recovered Sunday
night by police divers.
   The storm struck a wide area around Brisbane, uprooting trees,
damaging cars and houses, and overturning light aircraft at an
airport.
   Crews restoring electricity in Brisbane said some homes would
have to do without power until Christmas morning.
