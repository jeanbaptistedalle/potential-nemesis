   Grain and soybean futures prices slipped in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, with much of the
selling stemming from warming temperatures in the Great Plains and
Midwest.
   Moderating temperatures after a two-week spell of severely cold
weather eased transportation problems as well as demand for
livestock feed.
   Early selling in the soybean market also was linked to reports
of light rain in southern Brazil over the weekend and forecasts for
more moisture in that area, one of the world's major
soybean-producing pockets.
   It is early summer in Brazil. Dry weather during the planting
season had stirred drought fears, but those concerns have faded as
growing conditions improved in recent weeks.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to 1 cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $4.10} a bushel;
corn futures were \ cent to } cent lower with March at $2.38\ a
bushel; oat futures were 1 cent to 1\ cents lower with March at
$1.53 a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3\ cents lower with January
at $5.69 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which also reflected the warmer
temperatures in the nation's midsecton.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with
February at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .10
cent lower with January at 84.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
