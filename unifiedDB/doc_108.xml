   A Titan 3 rocket was being readied
for liftoff tonight with British and Japanese satellites on a
flight marking Martin Marietta's entry into the commercial launch
business.
   The 155-foot rocket was to lift off at 7:20 p.m. with the
JCSAT-2 and the Skynet 4 satellites. Weather could be a problem,
with forecasters saying there was a 40 percent chance clouds or
rain could interfere.
   JCSAT-2 will complete a two-satellite Japanese domestic
satellite network, providing telephone, television, facsimile and
high-speed data services. It is owned by the Japanese
Communications Satellite Co.
   Skynet 4 will be used by the British Ministry of Defense for
communicating with military land, air and sea forces.
   McDonnell Douglas was the first big U.S. rocket company to enter
the commercial market. Its Delta rocket boosted a communications
satellite for British Satellite Broadcasting in August.
   The Japanese company and the British government are sharing the
$125 million cost of the Titan 3 and its launch services.
