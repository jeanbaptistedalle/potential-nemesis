   A moderate earthquake shook western Washington
state early Sunday. No damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake, measuring 4.2 on the Richter scale, struck at about
12:46 a.m. PST (3:46 a.m. EST), said Bill Schmeider of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. He said the epicenter was
located about 40 miles south of Tacoma, Wash.
   People from the Canadian border to Portland, Ore., reported
feeling the tremor. Les Leland of KQEU radio in Olympia said the
shaking lasted about four seconds.
   A resident of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood said the quake
set off all the car alarms in his apartment complex.
   ``It was like being on a waterbed,'' said Doug Akizuki, who was
on the floor watching television in his apartment.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, and 5
considerable damage.
