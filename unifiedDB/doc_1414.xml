   China on Saturday denied giving sanctuary to
ousted Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``The notion that Ceausescu has fled to China is utterly
groundless,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu was variously reported to have fled
Bucharest after being overthrown Friday, but his whereabouts remain
unknown.
   Beijing has long been a staunch supporter of Ceausescu's
hard-line government, and there was speculation he might seek
refuge in China.
   Ceausescu backed China's bloody suppression of the student-led
pro-democracy movement last spring, and China's Communist Party
chief Jiang Zemin spoke recently of the ``sincere and profound''
friendship between the two countries.
   The Foreign Ministry declined comment on Ceausescu's demise, and
there were no reports of events in Romania in either the official
Xinhua News Agency or the Communist Party's People's Daily.
   Ceausescu has visited China at least six times during his
24-year reign. His last official trip was in October 1988.
