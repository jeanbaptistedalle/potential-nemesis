   Cold weather on Christmas
prevented the annual re-enactment of George Washington's famous
Revolutionary War boat ride across the Delaware River.
   ``We couldn't get our four boats into the river because it was a
sheet of ice,'' said James Gallagher, a real estate agent who has
played the role of Washington since 1985.
   On Christmas 1776, Washington was able to navigate the
ice-clogged river in darkness and surprise British troops camped at
Trenton, N.J. About 1,000 Hessian mercenaries on the British side
were captured and 100 were wounded or killed. Washington's force
suffered only 10 casualties.
   About 2,500 people braved the 20-degree cold Monday at
Washington Crossing State Park to witness the re-enactment,
cheering when 200 actors in revolutionary garb marched to the river.
   Although unable to cross the river, Gallagher posed in the bow
of a boat, wearing a colonial navy and buff uniform, covered with a
heavy navy cape, and wearing a tricorn hat.
