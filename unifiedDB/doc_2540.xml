   President Bush sent congratulations
to Vaclav Havel on his election today as president of
Czechoslovakia and pledged U.S. support for the rebirth of
democracy in the East European nation.
   The White House said the election of the once dissident
playwright ``marks a fitting end to a year of astonishing change in
Eastern Europe.''
   Bush sent the message from the remote Beeville, Texas, ranch
where he was winding up a post-Christmas hunting trip, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Havel, 53, jailed repeatedly over the past two decades for
defying Czechoslovakia's communist rulers with his calls for
freedom, was elected unanimously to the presidency by the 303
members of Parliament gathered in a medieval castle in Prague
earlier today.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement released in this Gulf of
Mexico city where the traveling White House was quartered, said:
   ``The president has sent a warm message of congratulations to
Vaclav Havel upon his election as president of Czechoslovakia. The
president noted the strong links between American and Czechoslovak
democracy, going back to the creation of the Czechoslovak state in
1918.''
   He said Bush ``pledged his commitment to the renewal and
strengthening of political, economic and cultural ties between
Czechoslovakia and the United States.''
   Bush's message, according to the spokesman, said that Havel's
election ``is living proof of what Mr. Havel has called the `power
of the powerless' to bring about peaceful democratic change.''
