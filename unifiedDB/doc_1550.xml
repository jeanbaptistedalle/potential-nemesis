   Grieving relatives flew to the northern
coastal town of Kempsey on Saturday to identify the 36 victims of
Australia's worst highway accident.
   Friday's head-on collision between two buses left 39 people
injured, some trapped in wreckage for hours, and led to renewed
calls to reduce the speed limit for buses and trucks from 68 mph to
56 mph.
   The cause of the crash was not known but newspaper reports
suggested one bus veered into the oncoming lane of the two-way
highway linking the cities of Sydney and Brisbane.
   Ten people were still hospitalized, and critically hurt were
airlifted to Sydney, 280 miles south, Kempsey Hospital official
Michael Doyle said.
   At least three foreign tourists were among the victims. Police
said they came from the United States, New Zealand and Britain but
their identities and hometowns were witheld pending identification
and notification of relatives.
