   The Nicaraguan government on Friday
devalued its currency for the 40th time this year and raised the
price of gasoline and public transportation.
   The move by the Nicaraguan Central Bank brought the official
rate to 38,150 cordobas per dollar. The previous exchange was
36,330 cordobas per dollar.
   Nicaragua regularly devalues the cordoba because of inflation
and to keep the price for exports competitive. After 1988's 33,000
percent inflation, the government took drastic austerity measures
earlier this year. It slashed the budget nearly in half by laying
off 40,000 government workers and restricting credit.
   Alejandro Martinez, minister of planning and budget, said
recently that the government's austerity program ``has shown
positive effects'' _ inflation this year had been lowered to ``only
1,500 percent.''
   Friday's price rises increased by 30 percent the rate for urban
and inter-city public bus fares. Nicaragua raises the price of
gasoline to keep it at a constant dollar price because it is
dependent on imports, for which it must pay scarce dollars.
