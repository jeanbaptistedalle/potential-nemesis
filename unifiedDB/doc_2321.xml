   President Bush on Thursday voiced
sympathy for victims of a strong earthquake that rocked
southeastern Australia.
   In a message to Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Bush
expressed ``condolences at the loss of life and the destruction of
property,'' according to White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The quake crumbled buildings and homes in the vicinity of
Newcastle, Australia, an industrial hub 75 miles north of Sydney.
   Reports suggested at least 11 people were killed, and possibly
as many as 30, with more than 120 injured in the quake which
measured 5.5 on the Richter scale.
