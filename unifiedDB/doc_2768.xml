   Robert Pirosh, who won the 1949
Academy Award for his World War II screenplay ``Battleground'' and
helped write the Marx Brothers' classic ``A Day at the Races,'' is
dead of heart failure. He was 79.
   The scriptwriter, who also wrote such TV adventures as
``Combat'' and ``Laramie,'' died Monday at St. John's Medical
Center, said ex-wife, Nancy Pirosh.
   Pirosh remained active through his later years, most recently by
teaching writing classes at the University of Southern California,
she said.
   His 1949 award-winning drama was based on the fighting between
German and Allied troops at the Battle of the Bulge.
   Pirosh fought with the 320th Infantry in the 35th Division at
Bastogne, Belgium, when U.S. troops were surrounded by German
soldiers for eight days.
   He worked as a writer, producer or director on a dozen
well-known films and a similar number of television series.
   His three-decade Hollywood career began in 1935 with ``The
Winning Ticket.''
   He was writer or co-writer of ``A Day at the Races'' for the
Marx Brothers; ``I Married a Witch''; ``Up in Arms,'' the 1944
Danny Kaye comedy; ``Hell Is for Heroes''; ``A Gathering of
Eagles''; ``What's So Bad About Feeling Good?''; ``Go for Broke,''
the 1951 recounting of Japanese-American soldiers fighting in
Europe; ``Valley of the Kings''; ``Spring Reunion'' and more.
   On some of those films, including ``Go for Broke'' and ``Valley
of the Kings,'' he also served as director.
   As a television writer, he wrote the pilot programs for
``Laramie'' and ``Combat.'' He also wrote several segments of
``Hawaii Five-O,'' ``Ellery Queen,'' ``Mannix,'' ``Bonanza,''
``Ironside,'' ``The Waltons'' and ``Barnaby Jones,'' among others.
   Survivors include two sons, a daughter and his sister. At his
request, there will be no services.
