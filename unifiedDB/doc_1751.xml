   Pope John Paul II today prayed that the hope
of Christmas may spread through an Eastern Europe ``awakened from a
nightmare,'' and he sought a special blessing for Romania.
   Emerging at noon on his balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square,
the pope delivered his traditional Christmas message and wished
Merry Christmas in 53 languages before tens of thousands of people
in the sunny square.
   The pope kept his head bowed throughout most of his speech, but
paused and raised his head upward after his comments on Romania,
where thousands of people have died in the revolt that overthrew
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``In particular, bless at this hour, O Lord, the noble land of
Romania, which is celebrating this Christmas in fear and trembling,
with sorrow for the many human lives tragically lost and in the joy
of having taken once more the path of freedom,'' the pope said.
   He also urged Europe ``to open her doors and her heart'' to
Eastern Europeans grappling with new challenges after toppling
hard-line Communists in power for four decades.
   ``May she respond with the strength and the generosity of her
Christian roots to this very special moment of history... which the
world is now experiencing as if awakened from a nightmare and
opened up to a better hope.''
   The pope did not mention Panama, where the Vatican Embassy was
surrounded by U.S. troops after deposed strongman Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega took refuge there and sought political asylum.
