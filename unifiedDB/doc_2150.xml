   The state Supreme Court won't intervene
in the case of two women at odds over their names, leaving the
small community of Salt Rock with two Shirley Bledsoes.
   The court Tuesday refused 4-1 to hear the case of Shirley Jean
Bledsoe, who asked that Shirley Rae Bledsoe be forced to change her
name.
   Shirley Jean Bledsoe contends the name has caused a mixup in
mail and telephone calls in the community of 900, situated about 10
miles from Huntington.
   The dispute began after a judge allowed Shirley Rae Lambert to
change her last name to Bledsoe in May. Shirley Rae Bledsoe said
she and her two children have used the Bledsoe name because it was
her common-law husband's.
   Shirley Jean Bledsoe argued the judge erred in granting the name
change.
   The two Bledsoe families are not related.
