<HEAD>Prosecutors Confirm Lineup in Shooting of Pregnant Woman</HEAD>

   Prosecutors investigating the fatal shooting of a
pregnant woman and the wounding of her husband as they left a
birthing class at a city hospital two months ago have confirmed
that a police lineup took place.
   Charles Stuart, whose wife and prematurely born son died as a
result of the shooting, viewed several suspects Thursday, a source
in the prosecutor's office said today.
   Prosecutors and police refused to speak on the record, and would
not comment on the outcome of the lineup, citing an ongoing grand
jury investigation.
   Several Boston media outlets, quoting unnamed sources, reported
that Stuart identified William ``Willie'' Bennett, a suspect in the
case, in the lineup. Bennett is being held on a robbery charge but
has not been charged in the Stuart case. His lawyer, Robert
Sheketoff, was not in his office this morning.
   Stuart, who suffered a gunshot wound in the stomach, left the
hospital earlier this month. His wife, Carol, died of her wounds,
and their son, Christopher, born several hours after the shooting,
died a few weeks later.
