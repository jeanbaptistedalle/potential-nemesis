<HEAD>Baker: `I Regret' Misleading Statement About China Contacts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
Sunday ``I regret'' giving a misleading account of the Bush
administration's contacts with China following the massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.
   Baker on Dec. 10 said in a televised interview that a trip by
two administration officials to China earlier in the month was
``the first time we've had high-level U.S. officials go to the
People's Republic of China.''
   A week later the White House disclosed that the two officials
who made the December trip, national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, had
visited Beijing on a secret mission in July _ just a month after
the Chinese government used force to suppress pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   ``I was trying to protect the confidentiality of a classified
presidential mission,'' Baker said Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet the
Press.'' ``If I misled anybody I regret that but if I did I only
misled them for seven days,'' he said, referring to the public
disclosure of the July trip a week after Baker called the December
Scowcroft-Eagleburger visit a first.
   Asked if the government officials should deliberately mislead
the public to protect secrets, Baker, said:
   ``No, we should not. And that's why I've said I regret it. ... I
could simply have `no commented,' which is what I should have done.
... I regret that and certainly I should have found a better way to
answer the question.''
