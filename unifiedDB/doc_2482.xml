<HEAD>Turner Sues for CNN Broadcasts to Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Turner Broadcasting System is suing the Bush
administration in an effort to gain permission to provide its Cable
News Network to Vietnam, a Turner official says.
   The Atlanta-based broadcasting company wants to provide a
satellite receiving station to the Vietnamese at no charge and give
them the right to take the CNN signal for 50 Vietnamese dong a
year, worth less than a penny, Bertram Carp, a Turner vice
president in Washington said Thursday.
   U.S. law prohibits most trade with Vietnam. Turner said in its
lawsuit filed U.S. District Court in Washington on Wednesday that
CNN would qualify under a 1988 amendment to trade law that exempts
information materials from trade sanctions.
   Turner believes that under the amendment, ``we're entitled to
this,'' said Carp.
   The administration interprets the law to mean that physical
materials such as books or videocassettes may be exchanged with
Vietnam, but not ``immaterial'' commodities, including TV
broadcasts.
   Vietnam now provides videocassettes for CNN's ``World Report''
program, Carp said.
   Carp said the suit, filed Wednesday, asks the court to order the
Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control to allow CNN
to provide the receiving station and signal to Vietnam.
   Carp said the Commerce Department would have to approve sending
the Earth station.

<NOTE>SmithKline Agrees to Pay $1.5 Million to Settle Kickback</NOTE>

   Investigation

   SmithKline Beecham Clinical Laboratories Inc.
has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a federal investigation of
alleged kickbacks for physicians who referred Medicare and Medicaid
business to the company, the government says.
   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general
found that more than 100 physicians were investors in three
California laboratories managed by the company.
   The inspector general's office said the arrangement under which
doctors were recruited as investors and lab profits were
distributed to those same doctors violated a federal law
prohibiting payments intended to induce referrals of Medicaid and
Medicare patients.
   The $1.5 million settlement was the largest ever made under the
law, the inspector general's office said.
   SmithKline spokeswoman Tobey Dichter said Thursday that the
settlement ``is an agreement that was reached to avoid costly
litigation and disruption to our business.
   ``It is not an admission of liability in any way,'' she said.
   The inspector general proposed the three laboratories be barred
permanently from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, Social
Security and California health care programs and that some
individuals and companies linked to the labs be barred for several
years.

<NOTE>Justice Claims Record Convictions</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Justice Department says it obtained guilty
pleas or convictions in a record 107 environmental criminal cases
in the last fiscal year.
   The number reflects a 70 percent increase over the previous year
and demonstrates the Bush administration's commitment to
environmental protection, says Richard Stewart, assistant attorney
general for the land and natural resources division.
   But department officials acknowledged Thursday that many of the
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30
and cited in Wednesday's announcement may have been initiated
before President Bush took office last January.
   The number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101, the lowest
number in three years, compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987.
   Spokeswoman Amy Casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 reflected in part the high
number of indictments filed in previous years.
   The 107 cases resulted in the collection of $12.7 million in
fines.
