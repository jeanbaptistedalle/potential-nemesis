   Sheriff's deputies responding to a call at
a house owned by actors Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward discovered that
the bombs used in movies look just like the real thing.
   The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Sunday the fake
bomb was discovered after a man called from Australia to ask if
deputies could check on his ex-wife and daughter, who were living
in the house. Authorities said the woman, who was not identified,
rents the house from Brown and Ward.
   Upon their arrival at the house Saturday, deputies saw in the
garage what looked like four sticks of dynamite connected to a
timer.
   ``Arson-explosives personnel responded and confirmed that it was
a movie prop,'' said Sgt. Mark Dailey.
   ``It ended up being empty tubes stuffed with newspaper,'' said
Deputy Steven Wilson. ``But it had all the right markings and it
was the right shape and color.'' He added that the device looked so
real the bomb squad decided to confiscate it.
   Similar props were used in the 1986 movie ``F-X,'' in which
Brown played a special-effects expert who used smoke bombs, fake
blood and dummies to elude pursuers.
   Miss Ward, who is Brown's wife, has appeared in such films as
``Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid'' and ``Sharkey's Machine.''
