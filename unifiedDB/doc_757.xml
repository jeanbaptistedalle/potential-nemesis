   Martin Marietta on Wednesday delayed
the maiden commercial launch of its Titan 3 rocket until Dec. 27
because of a forecast calling for several days of unfavorable
weather.
   It was the fifth postponement this month of the launch, which is
to boost into orbit communications satellites for a Japanese
company and the British Ministry of Defense. Three of the scrubs
were caused by too-strong winds about 30,000 feet above the launch
area.
   Liftoff had been rescheduled for Wednesday night, but with rain
falling throughout the day and with a forecast that the stiff upper
level winds would persist for several days, Martin Marietta decided
to put off the effort until after Christmas.
   The company said countdown would start Tuesday, aiming for a
liftoff at 7:24 p.m. Wednesday.
