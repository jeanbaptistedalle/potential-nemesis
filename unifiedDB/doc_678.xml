   The Soviet Union on Wednesday swiftly condemned
the U.S. armed intervention in Panama and demanded it end
immediately.
   ``The United States has launched an act of aggression against
Panama,'' state-run Radio Moscow reported. It said the Central
American country was the victim of an American military
``invasion.''
   ``These actions, a violation of the U.N. Charter and generally
recognized rules of state relations, should be condemned by the
international community,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P.
Perfiliev said. ``The United States must immediately stop its armed
intervention in Panama.''
   Perfiliev was quoted by the official Tass news agency as saying
that the U.S. action, ``whatever its motivation, has provoked a
feeling of serious concern in the Soviet Union.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
ordered U.S. troops to seize the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, and bring him to the United States for trial on
federal drug charges.
   Tass said Perfiliev commented in response to questions from
reporters.
