   When Ermelindo Martins saw what
looked like a giant turkey loose in Rio's zoo, visions of a
Christmas feast overcame his good sense.
   In a pre-dawn raid Tuesday, Martins and a friend attracted the
long-necked bird to the fence and broke its neck. As they prepared
to load the 65-pound carcass into a supermarket cart, they were
caught by the night watchman and taken to a police station.
   There they learned that their victim was a rhea, a rare,
ostrich-like bird from Brazil's central plains. Killing one is
considered an ``ecological crime'' and punishable by up to six
years in prison.
   ``It doesn't look anything like a turkey. And its meat is hard,
almost inedible,'' said zoo spokeswoman Esther Nazareth.
   She explained that the zoo had five _ now four _ rheas that were
allowed to roam the grounds at night. They had not been molested
until now, she said.
   Martins, 22, and his 16-year-old companion, whom police did not
identify because he is a minor, said at the 17th precinct station
that they lived in the Tuiuti Hill shantytown and had simply been
looking for dinner.
   ``We're not criminals, we were just hungry. We thought we were
seeing a turkey _ big, but a turkey,'' Martins told the Rio
newspaper O Globo.
