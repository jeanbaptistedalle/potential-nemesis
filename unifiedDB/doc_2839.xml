   Police fired on thousands of protesters seeking
the ouster of a Communist Party chief in a town in the Azerbaijani
republic, killing one person and wounding 162, an activist said
Sunday.
   The crowd of 20,000 to 30,000 people in Dzhali-Abad, near the
Iranian border and the Caspian Sea, surrounded the party
headquarters Friday to demand the removal of Kherula Aliev, the
regional party first secretary, Fazil Gamidov of the Azerbaijani
People's Front said in a telephone interview.
   Aliev was appointed by Azerbaijan party chief Abdul-Rakhman
Vezirov, and the protesters wanted to elect their own leader,
Gamidov said. Much of the region has been on strike for the
previous 22 days over the issue, he added.
   Police shot and killed a 19-year-old man when officers tried to
clear the area, Gamidov said. Some of the injured also had been
shot, and all the wounded were civilians, he said.
   Party officials fled and police sealed off the party
headquarters, Gamidov said.
   He did not know how the incident turned violent. But he said no
troops were involved, only local police. On Saturday, witnesses
told a rally in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku about the
confrontation.
