<HEAD>Uganda Says Sudanese Attacked Border Town</HEAD>

   State-controlled Radio Uganda claimed
Saturday that Sudanese troops attacked a small Ugandan military
post at the border town of Oraba, killing one soldier.
   The broadcast quoted a Ministry of Defense statement as saying
the Sudanese army troops struck the border post Friday morning and
were still in Ugandan territory at nightfall.
   The report said the Sudanese troops were traveling in 16 trucks
and supported by an armored personnel carrier and artillery. It
said the small border post detachment withdrew after one of its
members was killed in the attack. The Sudanese force then moved
farther into Ugandan territory, it added.
   The report could not be independently verified.
   Sudanese Embassy officials in Kampala refused to comment on the
report.
   Sudan's army has been fighting an insurgency in the southern
half of the country for nearly seven years, and the rebels often
cross into Uganda for sanctuary.
   The Ugandan military high command has accused the Khartoum
government of ``aiding and abetting'' Ugandan guerrillas who
operate along the border.
   In October, Uganda claimed several Sudanese warplanes bombed
another border town, Moyo, killing several civilians.
