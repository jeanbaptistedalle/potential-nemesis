<HEAD>Afghan Rebels Mark Soviet Invasion Anniversary With Rocket Attack</HEAD>

   Moslem guerrillas marked the 10th
anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan with one of the
year's heaviest rocket attacks on their nation's capital, news
reports said.
   There were conflicting accounts of casualties.
   Newspapers in Pakistan cited dispatches Thursday from Kabul, the
Afghan capital, with officials saying ``dozens'' were believed
killed when about 52 rockets hit the airport and residential areas
on Wednesday.
   Radio Kabul, run by Afghanistan's Marxist government, reported
18 people wounded but none dead.
   About 100,000 Soviet troops moved into Afghanistan on Dec. 27,
1979, to replace one pro-Moscow government with another.
   They stayed on to help fight the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who
began their insurgency when the Afghan communists seized power in a
1978 coup.
   The Kremlin completed a phased withdrawal of its troops Feb. 15
after fighting the guerrillas to a stalemate. Moscow continues
massive military supplies to the Kabul government.
   The Marxists still hold Afghanistan's major cities but the
guerrillas _ who call themselves Islamic ``holy warriors,'' _
control most of the countryside.
   Afghans at refugee camps in Pakistan held rallies to mark
Wednesday's anniversary.
   In Moscow, ceremonies mourned the 14,000 soldiers the Soviet
Union says it lost during the nine-year fight.
   Some 1.5 million Afghans are believed to have died in the
fighting. About 5 million have fled to Pakistan and Iran, or about
a third of the country's pre-war population.
