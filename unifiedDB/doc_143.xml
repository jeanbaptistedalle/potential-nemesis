   A sky diver making an illegal jump from a
high-rise was killed when his parachute opened backwards and
slammed him into the building, police and a friend say.
   Richard Allen Pedley, 57, of Walnut, fell 12 to 15 stories early
Sunday, landing on another structure, police said. He died at a
hospital.
   Pedley was with three to five other parachutists who jumped from
the unfinished, 40-story building. The others landed safely and
fled before police arrived, police said.
   Pedley had parachuted many times from aircraft but had little
experience jumping from fixed objects, said Jean K. Boenish,
executive director of a skydiving group and a friend of Pedley's.
   She said his chute opened backwards and swung him into the
building at least three times.
