   James Lawlor wants to send a greeting card
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. But first, he wants a million
Americans to sign it.
   Lawlor, an Iowa businessman, is touring the country with his
56-foot card as an expression of support for the Gorbachev's
reforms.
   On Saturday, the 34-year-old Lawlor was in this town's suburban
shopping mall, one of 50 stops he is making. He started his trek
last May, taking a break from his safety goggle business in
Fairfield, Iowa.
   ``This is to show the people in the Soviet Union that we do
encourage the positive things Gorbachev is doing,'' Lawlor said.
``It's a way to show them that we _ common, everyday Americans _ do
care and hope for the best.''
   The card, designed by art students at the University of Iowa,
shows the American and Soviet flags overlapping each other behind a
drawing of a dove. Its message, written in Russian, reads: ``Dear
Mr. Gorbachev and the people of the Soviet Union: We the people of
the United States of America wish to express our gratitude for your
contribution towards World Peace. Happy New Year!''
   Lawlor has collected 400,000 signatures so far as he carries his
card in a van. The effort is being paid for by contributions and
T-shirt sales.
   The card is actually his second to Gorbachev. A year ago, he
collected 30,000 signatures in a few weeks on a card sent to
Gorbachev.
   After a final appearance in New York City, Lawlor and a group of
volunteers plan to board a plane Dec. 29 for Moscow, where he hopes
to present the card to Gorbachev and have it displayed in the
Soviet House of Friendship in Red Square.
