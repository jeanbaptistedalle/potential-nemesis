   Iran's former president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, said
Monday he believes Iranian secret service agents are holding
British hostage Terry Waite, either in Lebanon or Iran.
   Bani-Sadr, who was the Islamic Republic's first president but
has lived in exile in France since 1981, said in an interview that
friends in Iran told him Waite had been ``in a safe place, in
security for several months in the hands of the Iranian secret
services.''
   He said he believed this could be a sign that negotiations for
release of Waite and other Western hostages seized in Lebanon could
be making progress.
   Waite, 50, the special envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while on a mission
to try to free Western hostages.
   No group has claimed to hold him, but he is widely believed to
be held by Islamic Jihad.
   Waite is one of 18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Longest held is
American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, who was abducted March 16, 1985.
