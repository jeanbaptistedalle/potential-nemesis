<HEAD>Fires in Suburban Post Offices Destroy Christmas Mail</HEAD>

   More than 1,000 pieces of Christmas mail
were destroyed in four post office fires that officials said were
the work of arsonists.
   Flammable liquid was poured into mail slots and ignited Sunday
morning, burning almost all the contents, police and fire officials
said. Several grass fires also were set in this suburb between
Dallas and Fort Worth.
   ``They're all arson. We're dead sure of that. The same person or
persons did all of these,'' said Stephen Lea, deputy fire marshal.
   Postmaster Mike Larntz said 1,000 to 2,000 pieces of mail were
destroyed.
   ``Anyone who dropped mail in those boxes after the last
collection should consider that mail gone,'' Larntz said. ``Any
salvageable mail, anything we can identify, we will make an attempt
to send anything back to the sender or receiver.''
   No injuries were reported. Damage to each of the post offices
was estimated at $5,000, not counting the mail.
   Walls, glass and ceilings were burned at the four post office
buildings, Larntz said. One was closed Monday because of fire
damage, he said.
