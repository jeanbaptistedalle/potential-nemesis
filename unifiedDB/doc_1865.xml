   A socialist deputy and publisher escaped
injury today when his car was blown up outside his home, police
said.
   An explosion caused by dynamite destroyed Makis Kouris' car only
minutes after he parked it outside his suburban home but no one was
injured, police said. No one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
police did not suspect Greece's three well-known urban guerrilla
organizations of involvement in the attack. He did not elaborate.
   Kouris, 47, and his brother, George, own three daily newspapers
and a radio station. He was elected to Parliament in June and
November.
   The Kouris' publications are unequivocal in their support for
former socialist Premier Andreas Papandreou. But critics in and out
of his party have charged them with using muckraking tactics to
villify political rivals.
   The brothers were strongly opposed to Papandreou's party joining
with the conservative and Communist parties in a coalition after no
party won a majority in November.
   Following the June elections, Parliament indicted Papandreou and
other socialist officials on charges of corruption during their
eight years in office. No date has been set for their trials.
