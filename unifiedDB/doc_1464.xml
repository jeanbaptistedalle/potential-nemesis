   Share prices rose after a shortened session Friday
on the London Stock Exchange, with most dealers and investors
remaining on the sidelines before the long holiday weekend.
   At 3:30 p.m. local time, when the market officially closed, the
Financial imes-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 9.0 points, or
0.4 percent, at 2,362.0. The market normally closes at 5 p.m.
   Volume was a light 375.3 million shares, down from 438.0 million
traded on Thursday.
   ``There have been one or two small buyers and no sellers,'' said
one dealer. ``There's no real trade.''
   Dealers said they didn't wish to take fresh trading positions
ahead of the long weekend. British financial markets won't reopen
until Wednesday.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 8.9 points at 1,862.2
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.43 points
to close at 1,280.27.
