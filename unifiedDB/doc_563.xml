   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction to their highest level in three
weeks.
   The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.62 percent, up from 7.60 percent last
week. Another $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average
discount rate of 7.43 percent, up from 7.41 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since Nov. 27 when three-month bills
sold for 7.63 percent and six-month bills averaged 7.45 percent.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 7.88 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,807.40 and 7.83 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,624.40.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, was 7.73 percent
last week, the same as the previous week.
