   Texts of Supreme Court opinions soon will be
available via computer within minutes of their announcement from
the bench, a court official said Monday.
   James R. Donovan, director of data systems for the high court,
said the experimental system will be put in operation, perhaps by
spring, for a two-year run.
   During an 18-month study into speedy delivery of high court
opinions in electronic form, a special committee headed by Donovan
originally envisioned letting some private agency distribute the
opinions to all interested parties.
   But it was later decided the court itself should do the job.
   The system ``is designed to simultaneously transmit the court's
opinions to a specific group of recipients, limited to those who
are in the business of disseminating information,'' Donovan said in
a letter of announcement.
   The number of recipients initially will be kept down by
``practical limits of system capacity and workload imposed upon
court staff,'' Donovan said.
   He said the number of recipients, each of which will pay an
annual subscription rate expected to be set at $500, might be
increased if there is demand and if the experiment indicates
expansion is feasible.
   Recipients, to be chosen by Donovan's committee, will be
expected to provide necessary common equipment, such as telephone
lines.
