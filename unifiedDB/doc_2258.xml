   Millions of Americans are still saying, ``I
Love Lucy.''
   A 33-year-old Christmas special from the 1950s sitcom finished
sixth in the latest Nielsen ratings.
   The black-and-white episode, which hadn't been seen on
television since Dec. 24, 1956, was CBS' highest-rated show of the
week and helped propel the network to its second straight
second-place finish in the ratings.
   Miss Ball, who died in April at age 77, starred in one of
television's most popular shows through much of the 1950s. The
``Lucy'' special starred Miss Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance,
William Frawley and Richard Keith as Little Ricky.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' was the top-rated show of the week ended Dec.
24. ABC's ``Roseanne'' was second.
   CBS beat out ABC for second place without much help from its
usual Top 10 shows, ``60 Minutes'' and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' both
of which finished far down the list.
   Fox Broadcasting Co.'s ``Married ... With Children'' plummeted
in the ratings to 72nd place after its Christmas special reached
13th.
   NBC was first in the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an average of
12.8. CBS was next with 11.7, and ABC scored 11.3. The ratings
represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households
tuned to a show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 14.8; ABC follows with
13.1 and CBS with 12.2.
   The Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Dear
John,'' NBC's ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' CBS'
``I Love Lucy'' Christmas special, ABC's NFL Monday Night Football
(Philadelphia vs. New Orleans), NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' and a tie
between NBC's ``Heat of the Night'' and CBS' ``Murphy Brown.''
   Other than the ``Lucy'' show, it was a ``bah, humbug'' week for
Christmas specials.
   CBS' ``Frosty the Snowman'' was 20th, CBS' ``A Very Brady
Christmas'' was 21st, CBS' ``Charlie Brown Christmas'' tied for
29th, CBS' ``Claymation Christmas'' tied for 41st, NBC's
``Christmas in Washington'' tied for 55th and CBS' ``A Christmas
Carol'' tied for 61st.
   The ABC movie ``Santa Claus: The Movie'' was 63rd and the CBS
telecast of ``The Christmas Gift,'' the pilot movie for ``The
Waltons,'' tied for 64th. ABC's ``Julie Andrews: The Sound of
Christmas,'' tied for 69th, NBC's ``Magical World of Disney: A
Muppet Family Christmas'' was 73rd and Fox's ``Simpsons
Christmas,'' repeated from the week before, was 74th.
   It was a big week in news, however, with the American invasion
of Panama and the revolution in Romania. ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' first for the 12th week, got its highest rating since
the week ended Feb. 3. ABC led with 11.8; CBS scored an 11.0 and
NBC 10.8.
