   The stock market staged a mild rally today,
pulling out of a weeklong slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 73.16 points over
the past five sessions, recovered 8.32 to 2,696.25 by 2 p.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 845 up, 622 down and
490 unchanged.
   Analysts said evidence of a new move Wednesday toward easier
credit by the Federal Reserve encouraged buyers to nibble warily at
stocks that have lately suffered from worries about a possible
recession in 1990.
   Brokers also said traders remained hopeful that stock prices
might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One explanation for the January effect is the lifting of yearend
selling pressures from investing institutions cleaning losers out
of their portfolios and individual investing realizing losses for
tax purposes.
   Stride Rite jumped 3] to 27~. Late Wednesday an investor group
proposed a bid for the company at $32 a share.

114|; Federal National Mortgage [ to 34{; Bank of New England [ to

value index was up .11 at 368.29.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 125.43 million shares with two
