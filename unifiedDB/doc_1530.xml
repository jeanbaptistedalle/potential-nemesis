   State television said today that the
Soviet Union had promised military aid to the popular forces that
ousted Nicolae Ceausescu and fighting in fierce battles with elite
police units of the ousted dictator.
   An announcer said without elaboration that the Soviet Embassy
had pledged such aid but did not elaborate on whether it would be
in the form of troops or equipment. In Moscow, Soviet media did not
report such an offer.
   The announcement followed an appeal broadcast by the television
from an unidentified army general, who urged Moscow to step in
because ``terrorist units'' loyal to Ceausescu had sent
reinforcements to the capital.
   Hundreds of people were killed in clashes in Bucharest between
the army, which sided with the revolt against Ceausescu, and police
forces that included Ceausescu's personal anti-terrorist squad.
   As dawn broke over Bucharest, anti-Ceausescu soldiers posted
atop the TV building fought with pockets of loyalists in nearby
apartment buildings in a firefight that lit up the early morning
sky.
   The general's appeal came shortly after 6 a.m. as the
anti-Ceausescu forces repulsed an attack on the television
building, which the popular forces seized on Friday and from which
they broadcast plans to hold free elections by April.
