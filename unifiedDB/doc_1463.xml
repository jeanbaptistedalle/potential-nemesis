   Smithkline Beecham PLC, a major international
pharmaceutical company, said Friday it has agreed to sell its U.S.
and Canadian household products businesses to a West Germany
company for $107 million in cash.
   Smithkline said the sale to Joh. A. Benckiser GmbH is consistent
with its strategy of focusing on international healthcare following
the merger of Smithkline Beckman Corp. with Beecham Group PLC
earlier this year.
   Household products included in the sale are Calgon, a leading
U.S. bath additive, Cling Free, a fabric softener used in driers,
and Delicare, a detergent for delicate products.
   Smithkline said most of the products are made at a plant in
Rockwood, Michigan, where 130 people are employed.
   The products were acquired in 1977 from Merck &amp; Co., which
retains the right to use the Calgon name for industrial products.
   Benckiser previously marketed Calgon household products in
Europe and the purchase will give it the right to sell them in
North America and other countries.
