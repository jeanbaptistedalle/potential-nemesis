   A soldier who led a failed
coup attempt in one of South Africa's nominally independent black
homelands has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for high treason.
   Warrant Officer Timothy Phiri was the last of 142 soldiers to be
sentenced for their roles in a February 1988 coup attempt in
Bophuthatswana, one of four tribal homelands designated independent
by South Africa but not recognized abroad.
   The other defendants, convicted last month of treason or
terrorism, were sentenced Monday and Tuesday to prison terms
ranging from 2 to 10 years.
   The coup was crushed by South African commandos, who freed
homeland president Lucas Mangope from captivity at a soccer stadium
and arrested the rebels, all members of the homeland army.
   Bophuthatswana Supreme Court Justice M.W. Friedman said Phiri
was ``a danger to society'' who had allowed Mangope to be
ill-treated during the coup attempt and had ordered his rebels to
fire on the homes of homeland Cabinet ministers.
