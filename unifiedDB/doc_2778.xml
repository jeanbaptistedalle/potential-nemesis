   A federal appeals court rejected the claim
by three battered women that the city of Butler discriminated
against them by limiting the number of people who could live at a
shelter proposed in a residential neighborhood.
   But the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the case back to
District Court to consider whether the city would be equally fair
if it banned such shelters from other types of neighborhoods.
   Three battered women, using fictitious names, filed a class
action suit challenging the City Council's refusal to approve an
application by the Volunteers Against Child Abuse Center of Butler
County to use a building it had contracted to buy. The suit was
thrown out and the women took the case to the appeals court.
   In an opinion last week, the appeals court held that the
ordinance limiting ``transitional'' dwellings to six residents, not
counting staff members, was not arbitrary and thus did not violate
the plaintiffs' constitutional rights of free association and due
process.
   The ordinance was ``rationally related to the legitimate
government objective of controlling density in a residential
neighborhood,'' the court said. But in areas other than
single-family-home neighborhoods, such a ban might not prove to be
as rational, the court said in returning the dispute to the lower
court.
   The plaintiffs had argued a shelter that did not house 12 to 15
women and children was economically unfeasible.
