<HEAD>Felix Bloch's Daughter Rips FBI Over Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents intent on arresting suspected Soviet
spy Felix Bloch attempted to turn his family against him, his
daughter says.
   ``They wanted my mother as the star witness. They were grasping
at straws _ they were desperate,'' Andrea Bloch, 26, said in
today's New York Post. The agents threatened to charge her mother,
Lucille Bloch, as a co-conspirator, Ms. Bloch charged.
   ``They were trying to pressure my father into breaking by using
us,'' she said. ``They wanted to make us so miserable that it would
make him miserable.''
   The FBI's plan ``totally backfired,'' she said, despite the
strains it put on the family.
   Bloch, once the No. 2 man in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was
followed by FBI agents for months after he was videotaped
purportedly passing a briefcase to a Soviet official in Vienna.
   The surveillance has been scaled back recently, and Bloch has
never been charged with any crime.
