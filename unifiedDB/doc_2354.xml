   A man paid a college student to kill him
by running him down with a car, police said Thursday.
   Graham Glickfeld, who was killed over the weekend, had made
similar requests before, but it was not clear why he wanted to die,
said police spokesman Dennis Satariano. ``But this was obviously a
man with some emotional problems,'' he said.
   The driver, Michael K. Doeschot, 27, a student at San Jose State
University, was arraigned Wednesday on murder charges and held
without bail.
   ``It was murder for hire,'' said Sgt. Mike Eads.
   Police would not say how much money was involved, only that it
was not a lot, and would not give details of the earlier offers by
the victim.
   The two men attended a Christmas party separately Friday night,
police said.
   Police responding to a call around midnight found Glickfeld, a
31-year-old supermarket worker, seriously injured in the empty
parking lot of a community center. He died a short time later at a
hospital.
   The arrangement between the two men ``probably took place within
a couple hours,'' said Eads.
   After the car hit Glickfeld, Doeschot ``called police to let us
know what's going on,'' Eads said. ``We had some idea it was an
intentional act from the beginning.'' Doeschot admitted running
over Glickfeld, the sergeant said.
   Detective Ken Bingaman said the men were acquaintances from a
theater class at a community college.
