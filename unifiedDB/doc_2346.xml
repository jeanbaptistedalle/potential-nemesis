   Kurdish rebels fighting for an autonomous
homeland have repulsed an Iraqi army assault on their bases in the
northern mountains, a guerrilla spokesman said Thursday.
   The official of the banned Patriotic Union of Kurdistan told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview that about 180 Iraqi
soldiers were killed in the Dec. 24-25 attack on the bases, which
dot snow-covered Mount Sadir near Qala Diza.
   The spokesman said 10 guerrillas _ known as Peshmergas, or
``those who face death'' _ were wounded in the fighting, which he
said was continuing in a diminished capacity. The official spoke
from a West European capital but asked that his name and location
be kept secret for security reasons.
   The official, who is known to The AP, said soldiers from the
Iraqi army's 24th battalion launched the offensive because ``they
were determined to capture those bases.'' He said one helicopter
gunship was downed by the guerrillas.
   Residents of Qala Diza were forcibly evacuated by the Iraqis
this year in a drive to create a buffer zone along the Iranian
border to prevent the guerrillas from receiving support from the
Islamic Republic.
   The last big assault on the area was in September. Iraq has
launched several concerted attacks against the Kurdish rebels since
the August 1988 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq conflict.
   Iraq's 3{ million Kurds have been fighting on and off for more
than a half-century for their own homeland.
