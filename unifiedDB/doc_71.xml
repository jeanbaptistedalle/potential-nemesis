   A Colombian intelligence officer who swallowed
drugs and a Peruvian congressman who failed to declare $25,000 in
cash have been arrested by U.S. Customs agents in separate
incidents, a spokesman said.
   Hernando Parra-Londono, a Colombian military intelligence
officer, was detained at Miami International Airport after getting
off an Avianca flight from Medellin, Colombia, on Thursday, Customs
spokesman Michael Sheehan said.
   He told inspectors he had come to Miami to visit a heart doctor,
but was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital for X-rays after he
displayed nervous and suspicious behavior, Sheehan said Saturday.
   At the hospital Thursday evening, Parra-Londono admitted
swallowing cocaine pellets, and as of Saturday had passed more than
100 weighing about two pounds, Sheehan said. No formal charges will
be filed until Parra-Londono had finished passing the pellets, he
added.
   In an unrelated case Friday, Peruvian Congressman Enrique Lujan
Pujada, 48, was arrested and charged with failing to declare more
than $25,000 in cash.
   He initially told inspectors when he arrived aboard an Aero Peru
flight that he had $5,000 in cash and another $5,000 in checks. But
when inspectors said they intended to pat him down, he admitted he
had more cash, and they found $30,280 in his pockets, Sheehan said.
