   Police arrested 118 people including musicians
Kris Kristofferson and Jackson Browne and actor Martin Sheen at a
demonstration Wednesday against U.S. support for El Salvador's
rightist government.
   Those arrested were among 500 demonstrators outside the downtown
federal building, where protesters have since mid-November gathered
each Wednesday morning to block entrances.
   ``I'm opposed to U.S. military aid to the (Alfredo) Cristiani
government, a right-wing terror-death squad government. It has been
going on for a long time,'' said Kristofferson as he sat down in
front of the building.
   Also sitting with Kristofferson was Sheen, who has been arrested
at previous demonstrations at the building.
   Browne was part of a group that briefly got into a shoving match
with police when the group briefly blocked a federal police parking
lot nearby, but returned to the federal building.
   ``We decided not to be arrested there because we would be
arrested by city police and separated from the group,'' Browne
explained.
   The building and its perimeter are under the jurisdiction of
U.S. Protective Service police. Demonstrators are arrested for
blocking access to a federal building, a $25 infraction.
   The demonstrations began after leftist rebels began a series of
attacks against the Cristiani government beginning in mid-November.
Those incidents have dwindled in recent weeks.
