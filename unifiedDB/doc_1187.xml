   The Southland Corp. announced Thursday it signed a
definitive agreement to sell its half interest in Citgo Petroleum
Corp. for $661.5 million in cash to the Venezuelan state-owned oil
company.
   The deal, first announced on Nov. 6, had originally been for
$675 million but was reduced in further negotiations between
Southland, which owns the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, and
Petroleos de Venezuela SA.
   The sale will be closed Jan. 31, Southland said.
