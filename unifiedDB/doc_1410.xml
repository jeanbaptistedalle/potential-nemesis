   Two women accused of taking a 3-week-old boy boy
from a hospital were charged with kidnapping Friday, hours after
the infant was found unharmed in an apartment, police said.
   Ellis Lyles Jr., born Nov. 28 at the hospital, was to be
released Thursday night after a three-day hospitalization for
gastrointestinal problems, said hospital president Michael H.
Sussman.
   He was found, safe and apparently well-cared for, at the
apartment of Sonia Rodriguez early Friday, hours after he was
reported missing from the pediatric unit at Norwegian-American
Hospital, said Detective John McKenna.
   Rodriguez, a 40-year-old mother of four, was charged with
aggravated kidnapping, as was Carmen Calderon, 20, said Detective
Philip Ducar.
   ``Apparently because they didn't see any parent of the baby for
two or three days, they thought the baby was abandoned, so they
were going to take him home and raise him as their own,'' Ducar
said.
   Rodriguez smuggled the baby out under her coat and Calderon was
a lookout for security guards and took some supplies to care for
the baby, Ducar said.
   The two women were in custory pending bail hearings.
   The baby, the son of Janice Holliday and Ellis Lyles Sr., was
last seen by hospital staff shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday, the
hospital said.
   Sussman said the infant was readmitted Dec. 18 with acute
gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.
