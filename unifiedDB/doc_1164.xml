   The City Council has unanimously approved
mandatory trash separation and recycling in a $160 million program
to cut in half the amount of garbage deposited in the city's
rapidly filling landfills.
   While about 1,000 U.S. cities have some kind of recycling
program, the Los Angeles effort will be among the nation's largest,
along with those in New York City and statewide in New Jersey.
   Mayor Tom Bradley said he will sign the measure approved
Wednesday.
   ``The era of the disposable society, when cans and papers can be
carelessly tossed aside, is coming to an end,'' he said. ``Through
this plan, the city now establishes a `no-excuses-accepted' policy
when it comes to recycling.''
   The plan will require all 720,000 single-family households in
the city to separate glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and
newspaper into different containers for collection. The city
eventually will sell reusable materials to recyclers.
   The program is to be phased in over three years, with the first
neighborhoods required to participate by next September.
   The $160 million is a three-year estimate. It has not been
determined whether the city or homeowners will pay for the hundreds
of thousands of bins and cans needed. It also has not been decided
how the program will be enforced.
   Also Wednesday, the council began considering a proposal to
force private trash haulers to recycle. Private haulers collect
garbage from businesses and larger apartment buildings, which
account for about two-thirds of all waste in the city.
