<HEAD>Mexico Denies Cuba Using Its Territory for Arms Shipments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Mexico denied on Wednesday allegations by U.S.
officials that its territory has been used by Cuba to transport
weapons to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   An official Mexican source rejected the allegation
``categorically'' because Mexico has built up a ``surveillance
infrastructure'' to avoid use of its territory for such purchases.
   U.S. officials have said that there are strong indications that
Cuban-supplied weaponry is being sent to the Salvadoran rebels via
a remote route that begins in the Yucatan Peninsula.
   The Mexican source, asking not to be identified, called the
statements by the U.S. officials ``irresponsible, lacking in
substance and false.''
   The State Department declined comment on whether Cuba has been
using Mexican territory to arm the Salvadoran rebels but said it
would not be surprising if Cuba sought new ways to transport
supplies to the insurgents.
   The administration has said Cuba traditionally has sent supplies
to the rebels via Nicaragua.
