<HEAD>Six Beheaded in Saudi Arabia For Drug Smuggling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Six people convicted of drug
smuggling were beheaded in public Friday in the northeastern city
of Arar, the government said.
   The six _ three Saudi Arabians, a Syrian, a Jordanian and a Turk
_ were convicted by Islamic courts of smuggling hashish into the
kingdom, the Interior Ministry said.
   Capital punishment for drug importing was introduced by the
kingdom in recent years in an attempt to curb drug smuggling, which
has been spreading rapidly since the oil bonanza years in Saudi
Arabia and the rest of the region.
   The theocratic kingdom rules by the Koran, which prescribes
beheading for murder, stoning for adultery and hand cutting for
theft.
   Moslem theologians ruled that capital punishment was applicable
to drug smugglers because beheading covered those who ``spread
corruption on the face of the Earth.''
   About a dozen other drug smugglers have been beheaded this year,
most of them Pakistani nationals.
   Beheadings are usually carried out in public squares opposite
mosques following the Friday prayers, and sometimes the bodies are
hung on crossed beams to act as a deterrent.
