   President Hissene Habre was inaugurated
Friday for seven more years in power after winning 99.94 percent of
the vote in a national referendum where he was the only candidate.
   The government of Habre, who appealed for his opponents to
return to Chad's political life, Friday also freed 45 political
prisoners, including former Secretary of State for Agriculture
Mokhtar Bachar Mokhtar.
   The new constitution approved Dec. 10 in the national referendum
made Habre eligible for two more seven-year terms. He came to power
when his forces captured N'Djamena in a 1982 civil war.
   In a speech Friday, Habre said the new constitution
``institutionalized the rule of law and deepened the meaning of
democracy'' in the northern African country.
   He said the constitution allows all Chadians to take part fully
in the affairs of state ``with no restraint other than the law.''
   Habre appealed to Chadians in exile and to the tiny minority who
voted against him to rejoin Chad's political life, saying he
considered himself ``president of all Chadians.''
   Forces loyal to Habre have ousted Libyan-backed rebels from most
positions they held. Only the Aouzou strip in the extreme north
remains in the hands of Libyan forces.
