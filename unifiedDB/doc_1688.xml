   A group seeking housing for the elderly
used a Christmas tree and its own version of the ``12 days of
Christmas'' to lobby Gov. Steve Cowper for a state ``gift'' of $5.6
million.
   Seniors for Congregate Housing wants the money to build a
40-unit housing complex in Kenai. The city has donated land and
promised to pay for utilities and operation of the complex.
   To get the state to chip in, group members made ornaments
representing an Alaska-style 12-day countdown. They mailed them to
a Juneau senior citizens' group, which delivered them to the
governor's office over the 12 days ending Friday.
   The ornaments depicted:
   ``Twelve seniors humming,
   ``Eleven just for the halibut,
   ``Ten cords of timber,
   ``Nine moose a-prancing,
   ``Eight grizzlies growling,
   ``Seven salmon spawning,
   ``Six derricks pumping,
   ``Five-point-six million dollars for senior housing,
   ``Four gold nuggets,
   ``Three spruce hens,
   ``Two king crabs,
   ``And a drifter in a spruce tree.''
   The drifter refers Cowper himself, who speaks with a drawl, has
a fondness for cowboy boots and is sometimes called Alaska's
``high-plains drifter.''
