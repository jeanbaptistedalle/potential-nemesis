   Christmas presents and two television
sets were stolen from the home of a woman whose serviceman husband
is with the U.S. invasion force fighting in Panama.
   The home of Sgt. Greg Widberg and his wife, Rachel, was broken
into sometime between 4 p.m. Thursday and 3:20 p.m. Friday,
according to a report by the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department.
   A 25-inch color TV valued at $400 and a 13-inch black-and-white
set valued at $50 were taken, as well as Christmas presents whose
value was not known because they had not been opened, the report
said.
   Mrs. Widberg was reached at a friend's house Monday but said she
did not want to comment on the theft. Her uncle, Samuel George,
said his niece is seven months pregnant and that her husband, a
paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne based at Fort Bragg, is with
U.S. forces in Panama.
