   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had begun work on
his memoirs and met with a New York lawyer to discuss publishing
rights the day U.S. forces invaded Panama, a newspaper reported
today.
   The Panamanian strongman knew at the time of the Tuesday meeting
that a U.S. invasion was imminent, a member of the law firm told
New York Newsday.
   Noriega had gathered material, including details of his work for
U.S. intelligence and his rise to power through the Panamanian
military, said attorney Barry Slotnick.
   ``He realized his time was very short in terms of his ability to
maintain himself in Panama,'' Slotnick said. The firm Slotnick and
Baker has held extensive talks with Noriega about the U.S.
indictments against him on drug trafficking charges, Slotnick said.
   He said Noriega met a member of the firm Tuesday in Panama City
to discuss publishing arrangements. Noriega said a ``substantial
portion'' of the manuscript had been finished.
   ``He knew the Justice Department wanted him on trial; he was
aware the United States was going to invade; he felt they wanted to
kill or capture him,'' said Slotnick, adding Noriega appeared calm
during the meeting.
   U.S. forces invaded Panama at midnight Tuesday.
   A publisher hasn't been found and a price hadn't been discussed,
Slotnick said. He said Noriega refused to approach a publisher in
the United States, or permit a U.S. company to base a movie or
television drama on it.
