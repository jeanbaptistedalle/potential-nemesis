   Secretary of State James A. Baker III notified
Congress today that the U.S. embassy in Moscow will be torn down
and a new one erected in its place.
   The decision, pending for months, was based on U.S. intelligence
conclusions that the Soviets had implanted sophisticated listening
devices in the structure.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe of Maine said she was ``extremely pleased''
by the decision. The ranking Republican member of the House
Operations subcommittee, she had concluded after inspecting the
embassy in April 1987 that tearing it down was the best solution.
   Another option weighed by the State Department was saving part
of the building after demolishing areas thought to be infiltrated.
   Kirk Walder, spokesman for Ms. Snowe, said Baker told her
construction of a new embassy would be undertaken ``under stringent
security safeguards and in full cooperation with intelligence
agencies.''
