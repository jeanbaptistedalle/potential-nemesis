   A 3-week-old boy was reported missing from a
hospital Thursday night after his mother went to pick him up after
a brief treatment for an illness, hospital officials said.
   Ellis Lyles, born Nov. 28 in Norwegian-American Hospital Inc.,
was to be released Thursday night after a three-day hospitalization
for stomach problems, said hospital president Michael H. Sussman.
   ``When the mother came in to pick up the baby this evening, the
baby was not on the pediatric unit where he was supposed to be,''
Sussman said.
   The baby was last seen by hospital staff just before 8 p.m., the
hospital said.
   ``We are talking to the mother to find out if she knows of any
relative or friend that may have come in to see the baby before she
came in,'' Sussman said.
   He said the infant was taken home after he was born late last
month and was readmitted three days ago with acute gastroenteritis,
an inflammation of the stomach and intestines.
   Police said they had no information on the case.
