   A Jewish group acting on the strength of a
favorable ruling by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan
erected a 18-foot menorah outside the Pittsburgh City-County
Building on Tuesday night.
   ``This adds some light to the darkness of winter nights and is a
victory for all the people of Pittsburgh,'' said Elliot Katz, an
attorney for the group Chabad.
   The city, which contends it has the right to determine what is
permitted in front of the building, plans to petition the U.S.
Supreme Court on Wednesday morning to have the Hanukkah symbol
taken down.
   Chabad was permitted to erect the display under protection of a
restraining order issued last week by Brennan. In an involved
holiday legal scramble, Brennan upheld U.S. District Judge Barron
P. McCune's order preventing the city from blocking Chabad's
installation of the menorah.
   McCune maintains that the courthouse steps are a public forum
open to all types of expression, and Brennan ruled the menorah
could be allowed until a trial on the matter is held in district
court.
   The Supreme Court ruled last summer that the menorah, a
candelabrum associated with Hanukkah, was permitted outside the
building because it was accompanied by secular symbols, a Christmas
tree and a sign promoting liberty.
   McCune aided the erection of the menorah Tuesday by reducing a
$5,000 bond that Chabad would have been required to post to cover
some potential court costs incurred by the city.
   Chabad requested the bond be reduced to $1,000 but, in a
compromise, McCune set the bond at $2,500.
