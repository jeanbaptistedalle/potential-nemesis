   A speeding car driven by a man trying to
elude state troopers slammed head-on into another car on an
expressway Sunday, killing three women and critically injuring the
man, police said.
   Robert L. Harrison, 30, of Youngstown sped the wrong way on the
city expressway for about three-fourths of a mile before the
collision around 1 p.m., police said.
   Harrison was believed to have snatched a purse at a supermarket
in nearby Girard, then escaped in what police believe was a stolen
car, said Girard Police Capt. Dominic Petrarca.
   A patrolman gave chase after seeing the car run a red light,
Petrarca said.
   Harrison eluded the police car. But when he spotted a state
Highway Patrol cruiser on Interstate 680 later, he headed eastbound
onto the westbound lane of the expressway, the captain said.
   The victims were pronounced dead at the scene. Their identities
were being withheld pending notification of relatives, officials
said.
   Harrison was listed in critical condition Sunday night at Saint
Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown.
   An officer who answered the phone at the Girard police
department Sunday night refused to say whether charges had been
filed against Harrison. He refused to give his name.
