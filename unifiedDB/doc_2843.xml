<TEXT>
   Philosopher Augusto Del Noce has died of a heart
disorder, Italian newspapers reported Sunday. He was 79.
   Del Noce was a prominent exponent of Roman Catholic thought and
wrote numerous books on religious faith in a modern society. He
died late Saturday.
   He was born in Pistoia in 1910 and graduated from the University
of Torino in 1932. He went on to teach political philosophy and
history of political thought at the universities of Trieste and
Rome.
   In 1984, he was elected to the Italian Senate as a member of the
dominant Christian Democrat party.
   His best known book was ``The Problem of Atheism,'' published in
1964.
   In a telegram sent to Del Noce's widow, Angela, Pope John Paul
II expressed his condolences and praised the philosopher's ``daily
commitment, in studying Christian thought, to seeking constructive
dialogue and developing the modern themes of philosophy.''
