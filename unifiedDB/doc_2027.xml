   Ford Motor Co. on Tuesday announced a
voluntary recall of more than 36,000 Aerostar vans and Ranger
trucks, citing possible brake or throttle defects.
   The automaker said it is notifying owners of about 32,000
1990-model Aerostars that the vans' master brake cylinders may
malfunction.
   In weather colder than 40 degrees, a seal in the master cylinder
could lose its effectiveness, which could cause excessive brake
pedal travel and increased stopping distances, Ford said in a
statement.
   But there is no chance that the brakes could fail due to the
problem, Ford spokeswoman Anne Doyle-Farrell said.
   Ford also is notifying owners of 4,355 1990-model Rangers with
4.0-liter engines that throttles may stick.
   Ford knows of no accidents or injuries that have occurred
because of the possible problems, Doyle-Farrell said.
   Of the affected vehicles, an estimated 855 have been delivered;
the rest are being held at dealers or are in transit to dealers.
   Owners are being notified of the voluntary recall by mail and
are being asked to return the vehicles to their dealers to have
corrective work performed at no cost.
