   A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the
unpressurized rear stairway of an Eastern Airlines jet that arrived
here Wednesday from Barbados, police said.
   An autopsy was scheduled to determine the cause of death of the
Barbadian youth, whose identity was being withheld pending
notification of his family, said Metro-Dade police spokesman Bill
Kinnebrew.
   Flight 928 arrived at Miami International Airport just before
noon from the eastern Caribbean island, and passengers exited
normally through the airport rampway, Kinnebrew said.
   ``Everybody got off the airplane, and when the ground crew
opened the back stairwell, they found the body,'' he said.
   The rear stair of the Boeing 727 stretch is used on smaller
runways without terminal ramps and by ground crews, and is not
pressurized or heated during flight, Kinnebrew said.
   The plane cruised at 35,000 feet on the 1,000-mile direct
flight, said Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak.
   ``Death could could have been either freezing or suffocation,''
she said. ``At that altitude there is very little oxygen, and it
would have been well below zero degrees.''
   She said the stowaway may have entered the plane in the Barbados
during servicing, but Eastern did not yet know if he had any
connection with the airport there.
