<HEAD>British Composer Sir Lennox Berkeley Dies At 86</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Lennox Berkeley, an eminent British composer
perhaps best known for his choral work the ``Stabat Mater,'' died
Tuesday at the age of 86.
   Berkeley, who suffered from a heart ailment and a type of
Alzheimer's disease, died in a London hospital of a respiratory
infection, said his son, Michael.
   Berkeley wrote opera, chamber music, concertos and four full
symphonies.
   He attended Oxford University where he read French, Old French
and philology before devoting himself to music.
   He studied under the great music teacher Nadia Boulanger in
Paris for five years and returned to Britain in 1935, the year of
his first major work, the oratorio ``Jonah.''
   Three years later he produced another choral work ``Domini est
Terra,'' then music for string quartets, solo instruments and
orchestra. His ``First Symphony'' was completed in 1940.
   The ``Stabat Mater,'' for six voices and 12 instruments, was
written for Benjamin Britten's English Opera Group and was first
performed in 1947.
   Berkeley was knighted in 1974 by Queen Elizabeth II. The
Composers' Guild of Great Britain named him Composer of the Year in
1973. Two years later he was elected to the presidency of the
Composers' Guild and the Performing Rights Society.
   Berkeley is survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Freda
Bernstein, and three sons. A funeral service is planned for next
week, to be followed by a memorial concert.
