<HEAD>Late Payments On Bank Loans At Decade High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of consumers 30 days or more behind
in their payments on bank loans rose sharply during the
July-September period to the highest level of the decade, a banking
group reported.
   According to a survey by the American Bankers Association, 2.88
percent of closed-end installment loans were delinquent in
September, compared with 2.30 percent in June and 2.42 percent in
September 1988. The steep rise followed two quarter-to-quarter
declines.
   Virginia Stafford, a spokeswoman for the bankers' group, said
Thursday that the next-highest end-of-quarter total was 2.74
percent, reached in the second quarter of 1980 when the country was
in recession.
   Robert Dugger, the association's chief economist, said an
increase was expected because of the slowing economy. However, he
called the current rate ``still in the manageable range.''
   Also, banks are making fewer new consumer loans. That means as
borrowers pay off old loans, the proportion in delinquency rises.
   The delinquency rate is based on a nationwide survey of 800
banks. It includes seven different types of closed-end consumer
loans: personal, two types of auto loans, mobile home, recreational
vehicle, property improvement and home equity.
