<HEAD>Mailer Upset About Mention in Broadway Play ``Tru''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Author Norman Mailer is upset about a line in
the new one-man Broadway play ``Tru'' that alludes to a 29-year-old
incident in which the writer allegedly stabbed his wife.
   Mailer said in a letter to co-producer Lewis Allen that the
reference was ``kind of crass,'' according to today's editions of
The New York Times.
   ``It's an ugly line designed to cater to rich out-of-town
yahoos,'' Mailer wrote to Allen, who also is husband of the
playwright, Jay Presson Allen.
   The line that irked Mailer is spoken in the first act by the
Truman Capote character, who is worried about his popularity in
1975 after a story of his was published in Esquire magazine.
   Capote, played by Robert Morse, is talking on the telephone and
tells his lecture agent's secretary:
   ``Listen, hon. When Irene gets back in, ask her when Norman
Mailer stabbed his wife, how much his fee went up.''
   The line refers to when Mailer allegedly stabbed his second
wife, Adele Morales, with a penknife after an all-night party at
his Manhattan apartment in November 1960. She declined to press
charges.
   In reply, Mrs. Allen wrote Mailer: ``A pretty poor show, kid,
for someone who over three decades has assiduously worked at
creating the very public image of a provocateur, a tough guy who
takes on all comers, a mythic brawler.
   ``But when a small shot comes your way, you toss your curls and
sob `foul.'''
