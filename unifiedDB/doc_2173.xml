   Doctors kept a close watch Wednesday on the
nation's second living-donor liver transplant recipient, who was
recuperating from follow-up surgery to reduce an infection.
   Sarina Jones, 16 months, remained in critical but stable
condition, according to Susan Phillips, a spokeswoman for the
University of Chicago Hospitals.
   ``She's experiencing some bleeding problems,'' said Ms.
Phillips, explaining that such complications are common in all
liver transplant cases.
   Sarina received part of a liver Dec. 8 from her father, Robert
Jones, a dry-wall installer from Millington, Tenn.
   Alyssa Smith, who was the nation's first living-donor liver
transplant recipient, remained in serious condition Wednesday. Her
condition was upgraded from critical but stable on Tuesday.
   Teresa Smith, 29, an elementary school teacher who donated part
of her liver to her daughter for the Nov. 27 transplant, was
released from the hospital two weeks ago. The Smiths are from
Schertz, Texas.
   Sarina underwent another operation Tuesday to remove a small
abscess from her abdomen, Ms. Phillips said.
   Sarina and Alyssa suffered from biliary atresia, a usually fatal
congenital defect which is the leading reason for liver transplants
in children.
