<HEAD>Cranston Calls Off His Wedding, Blames Stress And Media</HEAD>

   U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston announced Thursday
he has called off his plans to marry a 49-year-old woman on
Christmas Eve, a spokesman for his office said.
   The Democratic senator, under intense scrutiny for his role in
the Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan scandal, said through a spokesperson
that the wedding would be unfair to his fiancee, Cathy Lee Pattiz
of Beverly Hills.
   ``When the press pounced upon us before we filled out the
marriage license forms, it became clear to me that this is not an
appropriate time to start a marriage and it would not be fair to
Cathy to bring her into the middle of a stressful situation, so we
will not be married on Dec. 24,'' Cranston said in a prepared
statement.
   Cranston, 75, surprised associates recently by announcing he
would marry Pattiz at his sister's home in Los Altos Hills. The
marriage would have been the third for Cranston, whose last
marriage ended in divorce in May, and the first for Pattiz, an
Illinois native who has known Cranton since 1968.
   No other details of the decision were immediatley available.
   The couple appeared smiling Tuesday when they posed for
photographs while taking out a marriage license in Palo Alto.
   Cranston is one of five U.S. senators under fire for accepting
large contributions from Charles Keating Jr., the conservative
Arizona financier who ran Lincoln. In 1987, the five interceded on
behalf of Keating with a federal regulator involved in probing
Lincoln, which declared bankruptcy last April.
