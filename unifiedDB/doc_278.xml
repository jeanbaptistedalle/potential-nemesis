   A 72-year-old native of Byleorussia who emigrated
to Canada in 1951 has been charged under Canadian war crimes
legislation with the murder of 490 people, the Justice Department
said Monday.
   Bill Hobson, chief of the department's war crimes unit, said
Michael Pawlowski was arrested at his home in Renfrew, about 60
miles west of Ottawa, and was held pending a bail hearing.
   Hobson said charges filed in the Supreme Court of Ontario
specify eight counts of murder _ four under Criminal Code
provisions dealing with war crimes and four with crimes against
humanity.
   The counts accuse Pawlowski of murdering 410 Jews and 80
non-Jewish Poles in 1942, during World War II, in the Byelorussian
republic of the Soviet Union. No mention was made as to whether
Pawlowski was serving in a military unit at the time.
   He was charged with murdering 400 Jews in the small village of
Snov; 10 more Jews who escaped the first killings; and 80 Poles in
the same region.
   Pawlowski, described as a horticulturist, has lived in the
Renfrew area since coming to Canada in 1951; five years later he
became a Canadian citizen.
   Under federal legislation passed two years ago, Canadian
residents can be tried here for war crimes or crimes against
humanity committed elsewhere.
   The government has moved against two other people accused as war
criminals since 1987.
   The war crimes unit was set up after a royal commission
recommended urgent action against 20 prime suspects who came to
Canada after World War II.
