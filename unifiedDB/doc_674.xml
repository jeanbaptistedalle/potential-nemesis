   Scriptwriter Ben Barzman, who was
blacklisted during the McCarthy era and whose movie credits include
``El Cid,'' ``Back to Bataan,'' ``The Blue Max,'' and ``Z,'' has
died. He was 79.
   Barzman died Friday after suffering a stroke.
   Barzman, a journalist, novelist and author of musical revues,
began writing for the movies in 1943.
   He wrote or co-wrote the scripts of such films as ``The Boy With
the Green Hair,'' ``Back to Bataan,'' ``El Cid,'' ``The Blue Max,''
``Z,'' ``The Visit,'' ``The Fall of the Roman Empire'' and ``Heroes
of Telemark.''
   Some of the movies did not contain his screen credit because of
the blacklist aimed at writers accused of being communist, said his
wife, Norma Barzman.
   Barzman left the United States in 1949 for London, where his
movie ``Christ in Concrete'' was being filmed.
   The movie, recently purchase by Home Box Office for release next
year, went on to win awards at several European film festivals, but
Barzman and his wife were told they were no longer welcome in
McCarthy-era Hollywood.
   The government went on to revoke the Canadian-born Barzman's
U.S. citizenship in 1954. Although the government restored his
citizenship nine years later, he and his wife and seven children
continued to life abroad until 1976.
   During that time he wrote novels and French and Italian films.
His 1960 book ``Echo X'' won a Science Fiction Book-of-the-Month
Award.
   He was honored with a Paris Cinematheque film retrospective in
1982 and the French named him an officer of the Order of the Arts
and Letters in 1985.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Jan. 7.
   Survivors include his wife, children and five grandchildren.
