   Officials have rejected an offer by an
Italian Communist to buy a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin that was
removed from a public square after violent anti-Soviet
demonstrations, it was reported Thursday.
   Robert Napoleone, a member of the Italian Communist Party who
owns a Rome publishing house, offered to give the 30-foot monument
``a place worthy of a great revolutionary.''
   But the local government council in Nowa Huta, the idustrial
suburb built as a model socialist city in 1950s, decided the statue
``cannot be the object of such a transaction,'' according to the
state news agency PAP.
   The council also rejected a proposal by a Warsaw resident ``who
was stressing in the offer his financial and political
independence,'' PAP said.
   Demonstrators shouting ``Soviets go home!'' had tried to destroy
the statue and clashed with police during protests in November and
early December. The statue was quietly removed the night of Dec. 10.
