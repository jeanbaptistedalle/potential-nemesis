   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in
south Lebanon Monday for a third day with grenades and mortars. Six
people died and 42 were wounded, police said.
   The casualties brought the three-day toll to 38 killed, 150
wounded, police said.
   Police said the Syrian-armed Amal and its rival, Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, poured tank fire, mortar shells and
rockets on each other's strongholds all afternoon in Ein Kama and
Kfar Kila villages in the al-Tuffah region.
   Each accused the other of starting the fighting in the villages
about five miles northeast of Sidon, south Lebanon's provincial
capital.
   The latest round of fighting began before dawn Saturday when
Hezbollah overran four Amal-held villages. Amal rushed in
reinforcements Sunday and recaptured two villages.
   The two factions have fought for 2{ years for supremacy over
Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Since May 1987, such fighting has killed 609 people and wounded
1,719.
