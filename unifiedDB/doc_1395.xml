   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called Friday for
improved commercial and diplomatic relations with Argentina, but
she also insisted Britain retain control of the disputed Falkland
Islands.
   In a Christmas address to the 1,800 islanders, Mrs. Thatcher
said Britain, in recent talks with the new Argentine government,
had not wavered from its position that control of the South
Atlantic islands is not negotiable.
   In the speech broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corp., Mrs.
Thatcher said Britain would uphold its commitments to residents of
the Falklands.
   Argentine troops invaded the British colony off southern
Argentina in 1982. Britain sent troops and drove out the invaders
in a 74-day war. Diplomatic relations between the two countries
were broken.
   Argentina has claimed sovereignty to the islands it calls the
Malvinas since 1832.
   On Argentina, Mrs. Thatcher said: ``We want to improve ordinary
commercial and diplomatic relations because that is in the
interests of us all, including the Falkland Islands.''
