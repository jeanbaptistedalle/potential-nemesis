   A Japanese man was arrested at the
international airport trying to smuggle nearly 300 endangered
turtles and lizards to Japan in his suitcases, a police officer
said today.
   Tsuyoshi Shirawa, 20, was arrested Sunday after authorities
discovered that his four suitcases contained 98 turtles and 185
Oriental water lizards, said police Capt. Paiboon Arinchai.
   Shiwara told police he brought the reptiles from Malaysia and
stopped in Bangkok to visit a friend en route to Japan.
   Convicted of possession of endangered wildlife on Monday,
Shiwara received a three-month suspended prison sentence and was
fined $100.
   Paiboon said the reptiles were tightly packed into the baggage
and bound to prevent them from making noise and moving. Two turtles
and one lizard died.
   Boonlerd Angsirijida, a Forestry Department official charged
with wildlife conservation, said Japan was a major market for
wildlife from Thailand, Indonesia, the Phillipines and South
American countries.
   Last month, Japan returned to Thailand 58 wild animals that had
been smuggled into Japan. Among these were white-handed gibbons,
Burmese molurus pythons and slow loris monkeys.
   Thailand has been widely criticized as a major transit nation
for illegal international trade in wildlife.
