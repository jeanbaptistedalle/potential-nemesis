   President Bush on Thursday signed into law a
bill prohibiting U.S. support for international lending projects
unless their environmental impact is studied first.
   The purpose of the bill is to force international lending
agencies such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank to consider the potential environmental consequences of
development projects in the Third World.
   ``Multilateral banks should not provide support to projects that
destroy the natural resource base of countries we're trying to
help,'' said Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., who added the
provision to the National Environmental Policy on International
Financing Act of 1989.
