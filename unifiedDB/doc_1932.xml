<HEAD>Yugoslav Communists Propose Ending Monopoly on Power</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Committee of the ruling
Communist Party recommended Tuesday that the party adopt a proposal
to end its 45-year monopoly on power in Yugoslavia.
   The party will consider the proposal at its January congress in
Belgrade.
   The Yugoslav Communist Party was the first to break with the
monolithic communist bloc in 1948. But Yugoslavia has been slower
to adopt many of the democratic reforms now sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Secretary Stefan Korosec told the 165-member Central Committee
the party is ready for competition of ``equal political partners.''
   Korosec said the party will embark on reforms ``not to reject
the idea of socialism, but to preserve and develop it further.''
   The draft is a ``result of ambition to prove that we ... do not
find ourselves at the tail of reforms in socialism,'' he said.
   Other political parties have already been allowed in Slovenia
and Croatia, two of the six republics in the Yugoslav federation.
Serbia, the largest republic, decided this month to allow other
parties with some restrictions.
   Yugoslavia has a population of 23.5 million.
