<HEAD>Pan Am to Challenge American's Takeover of Eastern Routes</HEAD>

   Pan Am Corp. says it intends to protest American
Airlines' planned purchase of Eastern Airlines' profitable Latin
American routes.
   ``We strongly object to the further concentration of American's
market dominance in Latin America and the Caribbean through the
purchase of these government route authorities and facilities,''
said Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Manners.
   Pan Am contends that the route transfer from ailing Eastern to
the nation's largest airline will hinder competition.
   After months of negotiations, American said Dec. 19 it would buy
Eastern's Latin American routes and certain other assets from
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. for $471 million.
   ``The surest sign that an asset sale is good for consumers and
enhances comepetition is the opposition of a competitor in the
market,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said today. ``I don't
think anyone's surprised'' by Pan Am's plans, she said.
   Officials of American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, weren't
immediately available for comment.
   Pan Am intends to file its objections to the deal with the
Justice Department and the Department of Transportation after
American files its acquisition plan.
   Federal officials and the U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 financial reorganization must approve the
purchase.
   The sale would shake up the strength of airlines at Miami
International Airport, catapulting American from third place there
to first ahead of Eastern and Pan Am.
   Both American and New York-based Pan Am have boosted their
presence in Miami since Eastern was hit by a strike March 4 and
filed for bankruptcy protection five days later.
