   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Dec. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 8.13 million head,
up 2 percent from a year ago but 3 percent below the level of two
years ago, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in November totaled 1.50 million
head, fractionally below a year ago and 1 percent below two years
ago.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.99 million head, up 18 percent from a year
ago and 22 percent more than two years ago.
   This was the largest November placement total since 1977, and
was the result of cattle moving into feedlots rather than going
onto wheat pastures.
   Net placements of 1.90 million for November was 20 percent above
last year and 24 percent more than two years ago.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Dec.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.
