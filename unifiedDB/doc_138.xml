   An air force helicopter crashed
today in bad weather on Borneo island, killing all 16 people aboard
including several senior officers, military officials said.
   The U.S.-made Sikorsky helicopter crashed in bad weather near
Lundu, 540 miles southwest of Kuala Lumpur, Royal Malaysian Air
Force spokesman Captain Roslan Salam said.
   The officers were on their way to monitor a military exercise
when the helicopter crashed.
   The victims included two top Kuching-based army generals, Maj.
Gen. Mustaffa Awang, 50, and Brig. Gen. Hasbullah Yusoff, 47, the
army said. Mustaffa was commander of Army Region Two and Hasbullah
was commander of the Third Infantry Brigade.
   Also dead were the commanding officer of the 13th Royal Malay
Regiment, Lt. Col. Tengku Abdul Aziz Tengku Osman; the commanding
officer of the 5th Malaysian Ranger Regiment, Lt. Col. Mohamad
Johari; the pilot, Capt. H.C. Koey; and an army photographer, Cpl.
Ramli Baharom, it said.
   The helicopter took off from Kuching Air Force base this morning
for Sematan, near the Indonesia-Malaysia border in Sarawak state on
Borneo island, Roslan said.
   A board of inquiry will be set up to determine the cause of the
crash, he said.
   The crash is the second in less than two months in Malaysia
involving a Sikorsky helicopter. On Nov. 9, a similar helicopter
with 21 people on board, mostly members of the 19th Battalion
Police Field Force, crashed near Gunung Gerah on the Kelantan-Perak
border, 210 miles north of Kuala Lumpur. All were killed.
   Malaysia bought 40 of the helicopters and the first was
delivered in 1968. Since then a total of six have crashed.
