<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Cecil Franklin, singer Aretha Franklin's
brother and personal manager, has died of a heart attack. He was 49.
   Franklin, who died at his home Tuesday, had been suffering from
pneumonia for two months, said his wife, Earline. He was assistant
pastor of New Bethel Baptist Church in Detroit.
   ``Cecil was Aretha's biggest fan,'' his wife said. ``Aretha and
Cecil are very close _ they are more than sister and brother. Cecil
really enjoyed hearing Aretha on stage.''
   Born in 1940 in Memphis, Tenn., he became an aide to his father
about 20 years ago at the church the Rev. C.L. Franklin Sr. founded
in 1946.
   The elder Franklin, a civil rights activist, died in 1984 after
spending five years in a coma from a beating by burglars at his
home.
   In addition to his wife and sister, he is survived by a
daughter, Cristal; a stepson, Luren Bowie; sisters Carella and
Erma; a brother, Vaughn and a granddaughter.
