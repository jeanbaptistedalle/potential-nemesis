   A U.S. military officer killed last Saturday
night by Panamanian troops has been identified as Marine 1st Lt.
Robert Paz, 25, of Dallas.
   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy Wood, said today that
Paz was assigned to the Marine Corps Security Force Company at the
U.S. Navy's Rodman facility in Panama. His parents were identified
as Mr. and Mrs. Jaime Paz of Cali, Colombia. The Washington Times
said his father was believed to be a Colombian citizen and his
mother an American.
   Panamanian authorities contended that Paz and three other U.S.
officers were in a car that ran a checkpoint and that the Americans
wounded a Panamanian soldier and two civilians.
   The U.S. Southern Command said they were fleeing a crowd of
Panamanian soldiers and people in civilian clothes when the
Panamanians opened fire.
