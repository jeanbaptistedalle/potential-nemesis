   A firebomb was thrown at the Romanian Embassy
in Tel Aviv on Wednsday, causing a small fire at a nearby
construction site, Israel Television said. No injuries were
reported.
   The attack appeared to be in protest against Romania's
suppression of anti-government demonstrations in Timisoara, where
hundreds reportedly died.
   The Foreign Ministry earlier expressed Israel's ``deep sorrow''
over the loss of life in Romania and said it hoped Romanian
authorities would act with restraint and in accordance with
``humane norms.''
