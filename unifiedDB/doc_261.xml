   Two U.S. Air Force fighter jets
collided Monday during a training flight, and one of the F-16s
crashed near a vegetable market in Ludwigshafen, officials said.
Police said one pilot was killed.
   There were no injuries reported on the ground after the crash of
the two F-16s, the first about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt and
the second outside Bobenheim-Roxheim. Hesse state radio said 12
people were in the market at the time of the 4:20 p.m. crash.
   Spokesman Doug Moore said from the U.S. Air Force headquarters
in Ramstein that one pilot was taken to a U.S. Army hospital and
that his condition was not known.
   Moore said the fate of the pilot of the second aircraft had not
been determined. However, local police said in a statement that the
second pilot was killed.
   No names were released. The pilots were the only crewmembers in
the planes.
   ``Initial reports are that there were no injuries or casualties
on the ground,'' Moore said.
