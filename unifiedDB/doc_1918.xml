   A drunken former soldier threw
a grenade on a dance floor at a holiday celebration, killing
himself and four other people and wounding 45, the Red Cross said
Tuesday.
   The man, identified as Julio Retana, had been denied entry to
the Christmas Eve party in Santa Ana, 40 miles northeast of San
Salvador, because of his drunken condition, said a Red Cross
volunteer.
   The volunteer spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on
condition of anonymity.
