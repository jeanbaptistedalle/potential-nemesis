   Wall Street brokerage Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. will pay a $225,000 settlement to Virginia in a
securities and mail fraud case, state officials said Monday.
   The junk-bond dealer is also barred from soliciting new retail
business in Virginia for two years, the State Corporation
Commission said.
   Drexel has agreed not to solicit new business over the telephone
or set up new retail offices in Virginia for the 2-year period,
after which the company can request the commission's approval to
resume business in the state, the commission said in a statement.
   There are about 300 Drexel agents registered in the state, the
commission said.
   Earlier this year Drexel and its parent each pleaded guilty to
six counts of securities and mail fraud in connection with a
Justice Department investigation of insider trading.
   The Virginia Securities Act allows the commission to take action
against a brokerage if it has been found to have engaged in any
fraudulent transaction or convicted of any felony.
   The settlement is based partly on an agreement between Drexel
and the federal government, in which the company agreed to pay $650
million in compensation and fines in the insider trading case.
