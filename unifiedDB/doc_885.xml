   Hourly paid workers at the Ford Motor Co. Ltd. on
Wednesday voted 4-1 to strike unless the management improves a pay
offer within a month, union officials said.
   The Transport and General Workers' Union said 20,343, or 81
percent of voting members at the U.S. car maker's 21 British plants
voted to strike.
   The unions have rejected Ford's latest two-year contract
proposal of a 9.5 percent pay raise in the first year and a raise
of 2.5 percent plus inflation in the second.
   Ford unions are seeking a minimum 10 percent raise in the
first-year and a cut in the working week to 35 hours from 39 hours.
   Jack Adams, union chairman of the Joint Negotiating Committee,
said officials have not set a date to begin a strike.
   Wednesday's mandate to strike will lapse after 28 days, under
British law.
