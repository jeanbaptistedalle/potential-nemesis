   The engagement ring _ whether set with diamonds or other
precious gems _ is now likely to be more elaborate than the
long-traditional half-carat solitaire. And it's also more expensive.
   The average price of a diamond engagement ring in l988 reached
an all-time high of $1,325, a 23 percent increase over the previous
year, according to Lloyd Jaffe, chairman of the American Diamond
Industry Association.
   One of the reasons, he says, is that couples are waiting until
they are older to marry. ``(This) may account for the trend of
brides and grooms to purchase larger and better quality stones.''
says Jaffe.
   While in most cases the groom still pays for the ring, both he
and the bride share in choosing it, according the William G.
Underwood, president of the American Gem Society. He says older
couples, who account for two-thirds of engagement ring purchases,
are spending about three times as much as younger couples.
   The diamond association says that 73 percent of engagement rings
purchased in l988 were diamonds, while the gem society estimates
that about 55 percent of today's couples are picking alternatives
to the half-carat diamond solitaire.
   Diamonds are being picked from a wider variety of cuts,
including pave, baguette, channel and marquise shapes. And more
couples are choosing rubies, sapphires and other colored gemstones.
   The gem society says that women marrying for the second time are
likely to pick one ring, often set with one center stone and
complementary stones, rather than the engagement and wedding ring
combination.
