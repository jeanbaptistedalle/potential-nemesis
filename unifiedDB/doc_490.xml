   Ukrainian Catholic Church officials said Tuesday
that at least 100 Russian Orthodox priests and 200 parishes in the
Ukraine have registered as Catholics since the Ukrainian government
first recognized the church Dec. 1.
   The Ukrainian church officials, based in Rome, said the orthodox
parishes that shifted to Catholicism are near Lvov, in the Western
Ukraine. The officials said figures for the rest of the Ukraine are
not yet available.
   According to Western estimates, there are 4 to 6 million
Catholics in the Ukraine. Soviet leader Josef Stalin suppressed
their church in 1946, forcing them to convert to Russian Orthodox
or to practice their religion clandestinely.
   However, on Dec. 1, Ukrainian authorities announced they would
allow Catholic congregations to register like other groups.
Rome-based Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky called it a ``first step''
toward complete legalization.
   The Russian Orthodox have opposed legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, as they stand to lose hundreds of churches and
thousands of followers they gained after the 1946 repression.
   The decision to allow Catholic congregations to register was
announced as Pope John Paul II held talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Vatican, where the pope appealed to
Gorbachev to assure full religious freedom for Catholics in the
Soviet Union.
