   Shipowners of many countries that fly the flag
of Panama so they can pay lower wages and taxes won't have to
reflag their vessels, President Bush said Thursday.
   With the installation of President Guillermo Endara, the U.S. is
lifting sanctions imposed against the government of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. Bush said the action is a measure of support for
the new U.S.-backed government.
   One of those sanctions, announced Nov. 30 and scheduled to go
into effect Jan. 31, would have barred ships flying the Panamanian
flag from entering American ports. U.S. officials had said the
action would deny Noriega and his government tens of millions of
dollars of revenue.
   ``Noriega's cronies will also be deprived of millions of dollars
of illegal income in the form of bribes and kickbacks,'' the White
House said in a Nov. 30 statement announcing the sanction.
   Owners of ships registered in Panama pay a fee based on tonnage,
but they don't pay any tax on earnings as they might have to do if
they registered the ships with their own government.
   The flags of Liberia, Cyprus and the Bahamas are also called
``flags of convenience.''
   The State Department estimated that 1,500 ships of more than
1,000 tons would have been affected by the ban.
   Philip J. Loree, chairman of the Federation of American
Controlled Shipping, said that as many as 10,000 ships may fly the
Panama flag, but that many of them are small and never come into
U.S. ports.
   Loree said that registration of about 400 ships, mostly
Japanese, had been changed in anticipation of the ban at an
estimated cost of $16 million.
