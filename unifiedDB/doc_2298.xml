<HEAD>GM Plans to Cut 3,200 Jobs at Kansas, Georgia, Oklahoma Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said today it will cut 3,200
production jobs in February and March at three midsize car assembly
plants because of slow sales.
   The production cuts are in addition to previously announced
short-term shutdowns next month at 28 of GM's 34 North American
assembly plants.
   Two plants will scale back production Feb. 26, said GM
spokeswoman Nettie H. Seabrooks.
   GM will lay off the 1,900-employee afternoon shift at the
Doraville, Ga., plant, where the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme is
built. About 700 of the 4,200 workers at GM's Fairfax, Kan., plant
will be laid off, cutting production of the Pontiac Grand Prix,
Seabrooks said.
   On March 26, about 600 of the 6,000 employees at GM's Oklahoma
City plant will be taken off assembly line work as production of
the Buick Century, Pontiac 6000 and Oldsmobile Cutlass Cira is
slowed.
   Rather than being laid off, those employees will be transferred
to a ``jobs bank'' that provides them with other work while
production jobs are suspended.
   Seabrooks said the cutbacks are for an indefinite period.
