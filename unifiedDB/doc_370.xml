<HEAD>Judge Approves Sale of Braniff Gates to American Airlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge on Monday gave
cash-poor Braniff Inc. permission to sell valuable takeoff and
landing slots in Chicago and New York to American Airlines.
   Braniff arranged an emergency hearing in federal bankruptcy
court and obtained approval to sell one slot at New York's
LaGuardia Airport and three slots at Chicago's O'Hare International
Airport to American for $400,000.
   On Dec. 7, Braniff won court permission to sell an airport gate
in Fort Myers, Fla., to American for $2.15 million. U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge C. Timothy Corcoran III approved the sale on condition that
$750,000 be set aside in case Braniff is later liquidated.
   Corcoran indicated he would continue requiring some proceeds of
asset sales to be held in escrow, saying he was worried that
nothing would remain for creditors if Braniff were to be liquidated.
   Braniff creditors requested Monday that the $400,000 from the
slot sale be placed in escrow with the revenue generated from the
Fort Myers gate sale. Braniff attorneys agreed to the request.
   Since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Sept. 28 and
drastically reducing staff and flights, Braniff has existed on
emergency infusions of cash from the sale of assets.
   The Orlando-based carrier stopped operating all but a few
charter flights and laid off most of its remaining employees Nov.
7. Its workforce is down to 275 employees from more than 4,800
before the bankruptcy filing.
   Lawyers involved in Braniff's bankruptcy proceeding say that by
selling its assets, the carrier is trying to gain more operating
time until it can devise a reorganization plan.
