   Ernest Sisto, an award-winning photographer who
spent 49 years with The New York Times, died Friday. He was 85.
   Sisto, a long-time resident of Long Island, died at 3 a.m. in
his home in Rough and Ready, Calif., said his niece, Barbara
Castagnetta.
   Sisto was known particularly for his baseball photos, and he was
friendly with New York Yankees stars Joe DiMaggio and Phil Rizzuto.
He covered many major sporting events, including the World Series
and the Kentucky Derby.
   Sisto was honored for his work by everybody from the Press
Photographers Association to a cigar manufacturer. He relocated to
California after his retirement from the Times.
   He is survived by his wife, Amelia, and two sons, Daniel and
Ernest Jr. His niece said Sisto would be cremated, but had no
information about services.
