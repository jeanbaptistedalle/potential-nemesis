   Wheat futures prices rose modestly Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that China was seeking to buy
410,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat. Corn closed mixed and soybean
futures finished lower.
   The talk of Chinese interest in wheat was rooted in active
buying of wheat futures by commercial grain dealers known to do
business with China.
   The corn and soybean markets drifted mostly lower on
light-volume trading characteristic of pre-holiday sessions.
   ``It was a very quiet, dull session,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
floor trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   All contracts for December deliveries expired at noon. December
wheat went off the board 4 cents lower at $4.11 a bushel, December
corn was 1 cent lower at $2.33{ a bushel and December oats were 2
cents lower at $1.40 a bushel. There was no December soybean
contract.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.14{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats were \
cent to } cent higher with March at $1.52{ a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 2{ cents lower with January at $5.78\ a bushel.
