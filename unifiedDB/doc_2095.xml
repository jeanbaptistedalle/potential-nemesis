   A weakening Typhoon Jack began to drift
toward this U.S. territory in the western Pacific today and was
forecast to at least brush the island on Friday, according to civil
defense officials.
   At 1 a.m. Thursday, (10 a.m. today EST), the storm was 190 miles
east of Guam, moving west-southwest at about 3 mph. Its sustained
wind speed was 85 mph with gusts to 100 mph. On Tuesday, its
sustained winds were 135.
   Lt. Richard Bouchard of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center here
said at the rate the storm was weakening it could lose typhoon
status _ sustained wind speed of at least 74 mph _ before it passes
south of Guam.
   ``Forecasters can't determine how close it will come, but it's
expected to pass Guam during the day Friday,'' said George Toves, a
Guam Civil Defense officer. ``We'll get some portion of it.''
   The storm had been stalled about 200 miles east of Guam since
early Tuesday.
