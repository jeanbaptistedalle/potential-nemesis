<HEAD>Turner Sues for CNN Broadcasts to Vietnam</HEAD>

   Turner Broadcasting System is suing the Bush
administration to be allowed to provide its Cable News Network to
Vietnam, a Turner official said Thursday.
   Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting wants to provide a satellite
receiving station to the Vietnamese at no charge and give them the
right to take the CNN signal for 50 Vietnamese dong a year, worth
less than a penny, said Bertram Carp, a Turner vice president in
Washington.
   U.S. law prohibits most trade with Vietnam. Turner said in its
lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington that CNN would qualify
under a 1988 amendment to trade law that exempts information
materials from trade sanctions.
   Turner believs that under the amendment, ``we're entitled to
this,'' Carp said.
   The suit names as defendants Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Carp said.
   The administation interprets the law to mean that physical
materials such as books or videocassettes may be exchanged with
Vietnam, but not ``immaterial'' commodities, including TV
broadcasts.
   Vietnam now provides videocassettes for CNN's ``World Report''
program, Carp said.
   Carp said the suit, filed Wednesday, asks the court to order the
Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control to allow CNN
to provide the receiving station and signal to Vietnam.
   Carp said the Commerce Department would have to approve sending
the Earth station.
   Treasury Department spokesman Larry Batdorf said he could not
comment until department attorneys had reviewed the suit.
