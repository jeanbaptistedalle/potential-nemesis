continuing the trendless pattern that prevailed on Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .22 to 2,709.04
in the first half hour of trading.

557 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 14.90 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.

out of its recent lethargy. Interest rates were narrowly mixed in
the credit markets.
   Traders also appeared to be unsettled by doubts that a
significant yearend rally was in the making.
   Hilton Hotels fell 5{ to 84\ on a report that efforts to sell
the company had attracted lower bids than had been predicted.

index was up .29 at 371.09.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.13 to

120.98 million the previous session.
