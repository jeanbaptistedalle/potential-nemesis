   Energy futures prices were generally lower in
thin trading Friday as investors squared their positions in advance
of the long holiday weekend.
   Home heating oil prices, which surged in recent weeks as the
temperature plunged, were mixed with the January and February
contracts rising in anticipation of increased demand and the later
months declining. The January contract rose 1.93 cents to settle at
81.74 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after
rising more than 4 cents on Thursday.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures prices fell across the board.
   The February contract for West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude, fell 23 cents to $21.29 per 42-gallon barrel
after rising 31 cents in Thursday's session. The January contract
for wholesale unleaded gasoline was down 0.18 cent after soaring
2.41 cents on Thursday.
   William Byers, an oil market analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co.,
said investors were liquidating contracts before the three-day
Christmas holiday weekend because of forecasts of warmer weather in
the Northeast.
   Trading was thin and the markets closed early.
