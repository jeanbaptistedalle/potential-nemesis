<HEAD>S&amp;P: Inflation Will Remain Near 4 Percent</HEAD>

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. predicted Friday that
inflation will remain near 4 percent in 1990, after opening the
year on a price surge inspired by recent cold weather.
   ``The December cold wave will leave us with a January hangover
of higher prices for heating oil, other energy and fresh fruits and
vegetables,'' S&amp;P Chief Economist David M. Blitzer said in S&amp;P's
semi-annual consumer price forecast. ``But the damage will be
temporary and prices will return to their recent 4 percent track.''
   Blitzer said the soft economy will push consumer price inflation
below 4 percent by late in the year.
   S&amp;P is an investment advisory service that also rates debt
securities and distributes a series of widely followed stock
indexes.
   Through November, consumer prices have risen at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent, enough to cause the Federal Reserve to move
cautiously.
   ``Four percent inflation doesn't disturb most politicians or
most people, but it does bother the Federal Reserve,'' he said.
``Even with a soft economy, the Fed will continue to watch the
inflation measures very carefully.''
   Inflation has been close to 4 percent since 1983, the first full
year of the current record economic expansion. However, entering
the eighth year of strong growth without a substantial decline in
inflation is ``rather frustrating,'' Blitzer said.
   S&amp;P also predicted that air travel will rise 2 percent in 1990,
although bargain hunters should still find good deals; domestic
auto prices may drop; clothing prices will stabilize or drop;
gasoline prices will level out; and food prices will remain in
check.
