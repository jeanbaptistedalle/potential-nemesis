   An army patrol attacked a jungle camp of
pro-Cuban guerrillas, killing 43 and recovering a large cache of
arms and supplies, officials said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for the military command in Lima said one army
sergeant was killed and two soldiers were wounded in the battle
with rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the battle
took place Sunday in a remote jungle region along the Iscozacin
River, 175 miles northeast of Lima in Pasco department.
   The spokesman said army troops recovered arms and explosives as
well as radios, medicine, tents, uniforms and food.
   Sunday's battle was the most serious defeat for the rebels since
April 28, when an army patrol wiped out a column of 62 guerrillas
on a mountain road near Jauja, 105 miles east of Lima.
   The guerrilla movement, which advocates a Cuban-style Marxism,
has been fighting Peru's elected government since 1984. Estimates
of the size of the organization range from 500 to 1,500.
   It is smaller and considered less violent than the Shining Path,
a fanatical, Maoist guerrilla group that launched its insurgency in
1980.
   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in the
violence since 1980, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.
