   A U.S. soldier was sentenced to five
years in prison Friday on charges of killing a South Korean farmer
in a street altercation in the southern port of Kusan, according to
news reports.
   Air Force Tech. Sgt. Bruce A. Harayda, 29, of Bridgeport, Conn.,
was found guilty in a trial at the Suwon District Criminal Court
outside Seoul, said the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Harayda was picked up after the Feb. 11 death of Chong Pan-yong,
a farmer in Kusan, following a street altercation with Harayda.
Kunsan is a provincial port 132 miles south of Seoul.
   Prosecutors contended Harayda threw Chong to the ground, causing
cerebral hemorrhage. His death triggered violent anti-U.S. protests
by radical students in Kusan demanding punishment of the American
soldier and financial compensation to Chong's family.
   During Friday's trial, about 50 relatives and students shouted
slogans and demanded South Korean police hold Harayda in custody.
Harayda has been held by U.S. authorities, Yonhap said.
   It was not known if an appeal was planned.
