   The government Wednesday confirmed
Fernando Collor de Mello, a conservative who advocates a
free-market economy, as winner of Brazil's first free presidential
election in 29 years.
   Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old native of Rio de Janeiro and head
of the rightist National Reconstruction Party, had 34,698,234
votes, or 42.74 percent, after 98.9 percent of the votes had been
tallied, Supreme Electoral Court spokesman Irineu Tamanini said.
   His socialist rival, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the radical
left Workers Party, received 30,929,253 votes, 38.10 per cent. Da
Silva conceded he had lost late Wednesday.
   Tamanini said 1.2 percent of the ballots were blank, 3.81
percent were annulled and 14.15 percent were abstentions. Voting is
mandatory for Brazilians aged 18 to 69.
   Tamanini said the final vote count wouldn't be announced until
Thursday because torrential rain in northern Brazil delayed the
transfer of ballot boxes from the Amazon states of Para and Amapa
to Brasilia, the federal capital.
   The Court would officially announce Collor de Mello the winner
on Dec. 29, he said. The president-elect is scheduled to take
office Mar. 15, 1990, for a five-year term. He will succeed Jose
Sarney, who by law cannot run for re-election.
