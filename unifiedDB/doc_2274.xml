   A gasoline tanker carrying 20,000

   The collision at about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday involved a tanker
carrying 20,000 gallons of gasoline and at least one other vehicle,

   Four people were confirmed dead in the crash, he said.

   The accident occurred on Interstate 10 in Montclair, about 35
miles east of Los Angeles.
