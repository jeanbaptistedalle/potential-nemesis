<HEAD>Helicopter Crash Kills Five Near Biggin Hill Aerodrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A chartered helicopter crashed in bad weather near
an aerodrome south of London on Monday, killing all five people
aboard, firefighters said.
   The Bell Jet Ranger helicopter came down at Bottom Barn Farm in
Berry's Hill near the aerodrome, a Fire Brigade spokeswoman said.
   ``Five bodies have been located,'' said the spokeswoman, who was
not identified.
   Biggin Hill aerodrome director Keith Waud said the owners,
Starline Helicopters, were a maintenance and charter firm based at
the aerodrome.
   He said there had been low cloud, blustery conditions, light
rain and poor visibility when the helicopter took off.
   ``They encountered bad weather and in the process of returning
lost radio communications,'' Waud said. ``Observers on the ground
reported that the aircraft had crashed.''
   The Civil Aviation Authority said the Air Accidents
Investigation Branch of the Department of Transport had been
informed and would be investigating.
