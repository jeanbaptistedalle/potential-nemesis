   A passenger plane crashed and burned in
Bolivia's tropical lowlands on Thursday and 22 of the people aboard
were killed, including two American women, the air force reported.
   It said five people survived, but all were in serious condition.
   The air force Hercules plane provided passenger service to
several cities. It was bound for Santa Cruz, but crashed soon after
takeoff from Guayaramerin Airport, 550 miles northeast of La Paz
near the Brazilian border.
   The air force gave the names of the two American women to the
U.S. Embassy in La Paz. No details will be released until positive
identification is made and next of kin are notified, embassy press
attache Bruce Wharton said.
