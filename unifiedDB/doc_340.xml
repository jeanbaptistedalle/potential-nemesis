<HEAD>Rolls-Royce Workers End Strike After Winning 37-Hour Work Week</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of aviation
engines, cut its work week from 39 to 37 hours to end a six-week
strike by 2,000 engineering workers at its Glasgow plant.
   The workers voted by a 3-1 majority Saturday in favor of a
management offer to gradually reduce the basic work week to 37
hours by November 1991, Rolls-Royce and union leaders said. They
return to work Monday.
   In return, local unions agreed to greater flexibility on working
practices and job training to prevent a falloff in productivity at
the plant.
   Engineering unions have brought 10,000 workers out on strike
since mid-October in a selective campaign to shorten the standard
39-hour British work week for its 2 million members in 5,000
companies.
   Agreement on a 37-hour work week by 1992 has already been
negotiated at two other engineering companies, Smiths Industries
PLC of Cheltenham and NEI-Parsons of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.
   More than 7,000 manual workers at three British Aerospace PLC
plants in England have been on strike since mid-October in an
effort to win a 35-hour week.
