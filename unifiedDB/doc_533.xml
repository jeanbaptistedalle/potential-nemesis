   Crews plugged a howling, high-pressure leak in
a barge loaded with 16,500 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas
Tuesday, and officials let about 2,000 evacuees return home.
   About 45 square blocks of northern Houma, including three
schools, were evacuated Monday afternoon after the barge hit a
bridge on the Intracoastal Waterway, which runs through this south
Louisiana city, and began to leak.
   There were no injuries in the accident and the bridge was not
damaged, but the leak, howling from a broken 2{-inch pipe leading
to one of four holds on the barge, was audible a mile from the
accident site.
   Jim Drone, lawyer for the barge owner, Hollywood Marine of
Houston, said the vessel carried about 16,500 barrels, or 693,000
gallons of LNG, but the amount lost won't be known until the cargo
is off-loaded at a repair yard.
   The Coast Guard closed part of the waterway to navigation until
9 a.m. Tuesay. Authorities said the barge was loaded at the Shell
refinery in Norco and was bound for Victoria, Texas, when the
accident occurred.
