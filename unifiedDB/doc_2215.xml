   The stock market gained ground today, reviving
its bid to mount a yearend rally.
   Analysts found little in the economic news to stir the market
out of its recent lethargy. Interest rates were narrowly mixed in
the credit markets.
   But traders still appeared to be hopeful that stocks might
gather strength in early 1990, once yearend maneuvering by
investors for tax and portfolio reporting purposes is out of the
way.
   Worries persist on Wall Street that the economy will encounter
rocky going in the early stages of the new year.
   However, some analysts are predicting a relatively quick
recovery in business activity, given encouragement from a continued
easing of the Federal Reserve's credit policy.
