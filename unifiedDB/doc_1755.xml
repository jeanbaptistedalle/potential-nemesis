   Police on Monday defused a grenade
wrapped as a Christmas gift after the recipient discovered the
detonator ring protruding through the wrapping paper, officials
said.
   The package, wrapped in holiday paper, was delivered on
Christmas Day to the owner of a small hotel and rooming house in
the city's entertainment district, said police Lt. Edilberto
Capacete.
   As the owner was opening the gift, he noticed the grenade
detonator ring and called police, Capacete said. The motive for the
intended attack was unknown.
   Col. Ernesto Diokno, acting commander of the Western Police
District, said the grenade would probably have killed several
people had it exploded.
