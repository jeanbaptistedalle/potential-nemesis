   Thousands of ethnic Turks fleeing
Bulgaria went on a hunger strike Monday to protest a tighter
immigration policy, national radio reported.
   The restrictions announced last week reversed Sweden's
longstanding liberal immigration policies and reflected the
changing political situation in Eastern Europe. It also followed an
11-month influx of refugees that has become the largest since World
War II.
   About 5,000 ethnic Turks from Bulgaria, claiming discrimination,
arbitrary arrests and killings, formed the largest group among
20,000 refugees who came to Sweden in the first half of 1989. In
all of 1988, 19,000 refugees applied for asylum in Sweden.
   About half the Turks, fearing they may be sent back to Bulgaria,
began an indefinite hunger strike, refraining from solid food, the
radio said.
   Under the new rules, asylum seekers must show that their lives
would be threatened if returned. Previously, they only had to
belong to a persecuted minority group.
