   The director of an anti-nuclear power group
says he's alarmed the Beaver Valley nuclear plant did not get fined
for lapses that included security officers napping on the job.
   ``If you have this many lapses in a good program, it's scary to
think what a bad program is like,'' said Ken Bossong, director of
the Critical Mass Energy Project, which is affiliated with the
consumer group Public Citizen.
   ``The absence of any fines or other reprimands shows lax
oversight'' by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, he said.
   A plant security officer tampered with a safety-related device
and others slept on duty, The Pittsburgh Press reported Thursday.
   The newspaper also said a security supervisor at the plant in
Shippingport, about 25 miles from Pittsburgh, placed an unloaded
pistol in his mouth and pulled the trigger in January 1988. And in
October, two guards each allowed a person to enter the plant
without required authorization.
   The newspaper said its report was based on a review of NRC
records and interviews with officials at the NRC and Duquesne Light
Co., the operator of the two-reactor complex.
   Duquesne Light spokesman Kenneth Service said the incidents drew
strong disciplinary action, including firings and suspensions. No
fines were imposed by the NRC.
   ``Throughout this period we've had a high level of security and
continue to have a high level of security,'' Service said. ``None
of these individual items in any way degraded the level of security
or safety at the plant.''
   The NRC's past three performance assessments, covering 1986
through August 1989, gave Duquesne Light the highest of three
possible ratings for security.
