   More people than usual are expected to hit the
nation's transportation routes during the Christmas weekend, and
safety officials are urging motorists to be extra careful.
   Some 35.8 million people _ the highest number in five years _
planned to travel at least 100 miles away from home during the
holiday weekend, according to a national survey.
   The U.S. Travel Data Center surveyed 1,500 nationwide for the
AAA-Chicago Motor Club.
   About 5.2 million people planned to travel by car, the survey
found. The holiday officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at
11:59 p.m. on Dec. 25.
   With so many motorists on the highways, between 320 and 420
people could be killed in car accidents, the National Safety
Council said.
   Another 15,000 to 19,000 people could suffer disabling injuries,
the council said.
   During the Christmas holiday last year, 386 people died in car
accidents and about 17,900 were injured.
   Travelers should gas up their cars early because about
two-thirds of the nation's gas stations will be closed on
Christmas, AAA-Chicago said.
