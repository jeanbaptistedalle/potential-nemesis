   A senior Israeli official met Monday with U.S.
officials to try to lay the groundwork for eventual
Israeli-Palestinian talks, but the State Department had no comment
on whether progress was made.
   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Eliakim Rubinstein conferred with
Dennis Ross, a top aide to Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
Further discussions will be held Tuesday.
   Baker is attempting to bring the Israeli and Egyptian foreign
ministers to Washington next month for talks with him about the
proposed Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.
   If all proceeds as planned under Baker's five-point proposal,
Palestinian elections eventually would take place in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Both Israel and Egypt have accepted the Baker plan
but have attached certain reservations.
   Egypt has been serving as an intermediary between Baker and the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Egypt is sending no special representative from Cairo for this
week's discussions but Ambassador Sayed el Reedy is available for
consultations.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is vehemently opposed to
any PLO participation in the dialogue while Egypt insists the PLO
must have a role if the peace effort is to succeed.
