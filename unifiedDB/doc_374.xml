<HEAD>Ford Boosts Minivan Incentive Program To Match Chrysler's</HEAD>

   Ford Motor Co. announced Monday it is offering
rebates of up to $1,000 on all 1989 and 1990 Aerostar minivans,
matching incentives announced last week by Chrysler Corp.
   Effective Monday, rebates on 1989 Aerostars were increased from
$500 to $1,000, and $1,000 rebates were offered on all 1990 models,
Ford said.
   The incentives will be offered indefinitely, the automaker said.
   On Friday, Chrysler for the first time began offering rebates on
its popular minivans, the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and
Chrysler Town and Country. The rebates are $1,000. Chrysler
dominates the market for minivans, a class of vehicle it created.
   General Motors Corp. has not said whether it will offer similar
incentives for its minivans.
   The rebates come at a time of a continuing sales slump in the
auto industry that has lead to widespread temporary plant shutdowns.
