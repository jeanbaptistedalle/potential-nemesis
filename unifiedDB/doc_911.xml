   The stock market posted a small loss today,
registering no strong reaction to the U.S. military action in
Panama.
   Analysts said investors were cautiously watching the situation
in Panama, but apparently not viewing it as any cause to make big
changes in their strategies.
   They noted that the prospective economic effects of the
confrontation, if any, remained unclear.
   At the same time, brokers said, stock traders appeared to draw
only brief encouragement from an upward revision in the latest
government figures on economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 3.0 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
third quarter of the year, up from a previous estimate of 2.7
percent.
   Economists' projections remained gloomy, however, for the
results to be posted in the fourth quarter and the early stages of
1990.
