   The dollar fell against all major foreign
currencies today in lackluster pre-holiday European trading. Gold
prices were up slightly in thin dealings.
   Traders said many market players already have left for extended
holiday vacations.
   ``It's absolutely dead today,'' said a trader at a large
commercial bank in Frankfurt. ``There's nothing going on. People
are just sitting around their offices waiting for quitting time.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.10 yen to a closing 143.67 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 143.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.7145 West German marks, down from 1.7250
   _1.5523 Swiss francs, down from 1.5575
   _5.8530 French francs, down from 5.8955
   _1.9435 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9560
   _1,281.50 Italian lire, down from 1,287.50
   _1.1598 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1605
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6165 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6125 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.00 a troy ounce, up
from $412.75 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413.00, unchanged from the bid
late Thursday.
