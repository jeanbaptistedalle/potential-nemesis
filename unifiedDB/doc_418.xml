<HEAD>Chicago Suburb to Pay $650,000 in Housing Case</HEAD>

   A Chicago suburb has agreed to pay $650,000 to
the former owner of an apartment complex who contended he was
forced out of business for renting to too many blacks.
   George Cadar of Chicago charged in a lawsuit that the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development had foreclosed on his
complex in 1985 after Earl Bell, then president of the village of
University Park, wrote letters saying the unit was poorly managed
and rife with gang activity.
   Witnesses during the federal trial said Cadar had been singled
out because Bell believed he rented to too many blacks and because
Cadar was Bell's political rival.
   Testimony showed that no gang member had ever been arrested on
the apartment grounds and that the complex was well-maintained,
said Matthew Piers, Cadar's attorney.
   The jury Friday decided that Cadar's civil rights had been
violated and that Bell had caused HUD to foreclose on the 437-unit
complex, and it awarded Cadar $1.3 million.
   But under a settlement reached before the verdict was announced,
he agreed to accept no more than $650,000 if the village promised
not to appeal.
   Bell, president of the village of 6,300 from 1983 to 1985, said
Monday that HUD was justified in taking over the complex in 1985
because it was $10 million in debt.
