<HEAD>Stocks At Another Record High, Dollar Inches Up</HEAD>

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index closed at
a record high for the third consecutive day today, while the dollar
inched up against the Japanese yen after a five-day decline.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed up 75.31
points, or 0.19 percent, at 38,876.94. The index has gained 453.32,
or 1.18 percent, in the last three days.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 142.10 yen. After opening at 142.00 yen, the dollar
ranged between 141.99 yen and 142.17 yen. It had declined a total
of 2.13 yen in the previous five trading days.
   The key stock index fell moderately in today's early trading,
with profit-taking selling outpacing small-lot buying. But the
index rebounded in the afternoon on buying by investment trust
funds, said Nomura Securities dealer Toshinao Nakamura.
   With most institutional and corporate investors on the sidelines
ahead of the New Year's holidays, trading generally was slow and
quiet, other dealers said.
   With no focus to trading, investors might have left for the
holidays without waiting for Friday's session, the last of the
year, they said.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at a small 550 million
shares, down from 930 million Wednesday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range in
thin trading, a usual trend toward the year-end.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the dollar would move lower early next year in
anticipation of a further downswing in U.S. interest rates, the
subject of speculation in recent weeks.
   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
