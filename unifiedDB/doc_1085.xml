<HEAD>Bush to Attend Drug Summit Despite Peru's Panama Protest</HEAD>

   President Bush plans to attend a February drug
summit in Colombia despite the decision by Peru, the world's
largest cocaine producer, to cancel in protest of the U.S. assault
on Panama, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday.
   Peru issued a strongly worded statement Wednesday condeming the
use of force in Panama, recalling its ambassador from Washington
and calling for a postponement of the scheduled Feb. 15 summit. It
did not offer an alternative date.
   The other countries scheduled to attend the meeting are Colombia
and Bolivia. Both those nations issued statements condeming the
U.S. actions in Panama but did not mention the drug summit.
   Bush has said he will go to Cartagena, Colombia as a show of
support for President Virgilio Barco, whose nation has been at war
with drug lords.
   The assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
Bernard Aronson, traveled to Peru earlier this month for a meeting
with Peruvian President Alan Garcia to outline the drug summit
agenda. Bush has proposed $2.2 billion over the next five years for
the three Andean nations to fight drugs.
   Earlier this week there were rumors that the Colombian drug
leaders have taken out a $30 million contract on Bush's life.
