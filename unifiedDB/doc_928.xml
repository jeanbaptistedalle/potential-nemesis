   A Canadian company has agreed to buy the
heating and air conditioning division of the Coleman Co., Coleman
said Wednesday.
   A Coleman spokesman said the financial terms of the deal with
Beacon International Ltd. of Toronto wouldn't be announced. The
transaction is scheduled to be completed in early 1990.
   Beacon International is a subsidiary of Beacon Capital Corp., a
small holding company.
   Coleman officials said the 650 workers in the division likely
won't notice much change under the new owner.
   There had been fears a Coleman competitor would buy the division
and move it or close it.
   In addition to a Wichita plant with more than 1 million square
feet of manufacturing and office space, the division has a smaller
factory employing 96 workers in Nacodoches, Texas, and a
distribution center in Tornoto.
   Gross division sales in 1988 were $124.8 million.
   Coleman has been trying to sell the division and several other
units since Wall Street investor Ronald O. Perelman acquired the
company from the Coleman family earlier this year.
   In November, Coleman's Crosman Products unit was sold for $41
million to an investor group that included senior managers from the
division.
   A tentative deal for the sale of the Coleman Camping Trailers
division is awaiting finalization.
