   A U.S. Air Force F-4 Phantom crashed
Wednesday in the South China Sea, but both crewmen ejected and were
rescued, the U.S. military announced.
   The aircraft was on a routine training flight when the crash
occurred about 50 miles west of Clark Air Base in the South China
Sea, the Air Force said.
   The pilot reported engine trouble and radioed a distress signal,
and the men were rescued by helicopter and taken to the 13th U.S.
Air Force hospital at Clark, where they were reported out of
danger, the Air Force said.
   The Air Force identified them as Maj. Gary Barrentine and 1st
Lt. William Cameron, both assigned at Clark. No hometowns were
released.
