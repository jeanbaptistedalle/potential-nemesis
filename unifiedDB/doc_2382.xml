   Gunmen defending positions inside a
Sikh temple fought an hourlong battle with security forces
Thursday, and at least four police officers were killed,
authorities said.
   The suspected Sikh extremists escaped after the fighting at the
Darbar Sahib temple in this rural area in the northern state of
Punjab, which borders Pakistan.
   The temple, one of the holiest Sikh shrines, is next in
importance to the Golden Temple in Amristar, about 15 miles south.
   The Amritsar shrine was attacked by the army on June 3, 1984, to
flush out Sikh extremists. Sikh militants have been fighting since
1983 to establish a separate homeland in Punjab, a rich farming
state in northern India.
   The deputy inspector-general of police, Gurinder Singh Bhullar,
said the fighting began after extremists ambushed and killed four
policemen outside the temple.
   ``The extremists then ran inside taking with them a wireless
set, a light machine gun, three rifles and some ammunition of the
policemen,'' Bhullar said.
   The extremists defended their positions for an hour as about 500
policemen surrounded the temple and exchanged fire, he said.
   About 85 Sikhs came out with their hands raised after the
shooting, but police failed to find any of the militants inside.
   Sikh militants are demanding an independent nation because they
say they are discriminated against culturally and politically by
Hindus and the Hindu-dominated government.
   Sikhs, who form 2 percent of India's 880 million people, are in
a slight majority in Punjab. Nationwide, Hindus comprise 82 percent.
