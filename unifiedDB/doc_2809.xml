   Martin Marietta was forced Saturday
to postpone for the ninth time the first commercial launch of its
Titan 3 rocket, once again because of high-altitude crosswinds
streaking up to 102 mph.
   The rocket is to boost communications satellites into orbit for
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British Ministry
of Defence.
   Liftoff originally was scheduled Dec. 7, but a technical problem
delayed one launch effort and the rest were scrubbed because of
high winds.
   The winds had been acceptable earlier Saturday, but the speed
increased throughout the day as a series of weather balloons shot
into the sky.
   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch team
held it for 50 minutes while officials assessed last-minute balloon
data. It showed 102 mph winds at 34,790 feet, about 30 mph too high
for a safe Titan passage.
   A 10th attempt was scheduled for 7:07 p.m. Sunday night.
