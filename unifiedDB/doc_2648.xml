   Grain and soybean futures prices were little
changed in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade with
no significant news to move prices.
   ``It's pretty much dead in the water,'' said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc., a Chicago-based brokers'
advisory service.
   A slight early decline in the soybean market reflected some
profit-taking after Thursday's strong gains, which were fueled by
expectations of new sales of U.S. soybean meal to Eastern European
countries.
   Corn futures also were fractionally lower while the wheat market
was narrowly mixed.
   The markets were scheduled to close early, at noon CST, today,
the last trading day of 1989.

oats were { cent higher across the board with March at $1.54{ a
