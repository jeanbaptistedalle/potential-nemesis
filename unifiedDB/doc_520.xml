   Stiff high-altitude wind Tuesday
night forced Martin Marietta to postpone for the fourth time the
maiden launch of its commercial Titan 3 rocket.
   ``The upper level winds are too strong for Titan this evening,''
launch commentator Bob Gordon said. The announcement came after the
countdown reached the five-minute mark and was held there for a
weather evaluation.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:21 p.m. Wednesday.
   The Titan 3 was to boost into orbit communications satellites
for a Japanese company and the British Ministry of Defence.
   High wind at an altitude of 27,000 feet also caused a scrub
Monday night. Technical and weather problems caused two
postponements earlier in the month.
