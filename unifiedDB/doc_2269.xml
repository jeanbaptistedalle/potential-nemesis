   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin is running for
president of the Soviet Union's largest republic, a Soviet news
service reported today.
   Yeltsin, who won more than 5 million votes in Moscow elections
with his anti-elite stance and calls for more radical reform, has
accepted a nomination to be president of the Russian Federation,
the Interfax news agency said.
   Voters in Ramenki, a town near Moscow, nominated him, said
Interfax, which is affiliated with state-run Radio Moscow.
   Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow Party chief in late
1987 for his outspoken criticism of the slow pace of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms. He was later given a state post in
construction with the rank of minister.
   The 58-year-old former engineer parlayed his image as a fighter
for justice and victim of the party apparatus into a sweeping
victory in March elections for the Soviet Congress, when he won 89
percent of the Moscow vote.
   At the Congress, Yeltsin has emerged as a leader of the
fledgling opposition to Communist Party leaders and has continued
to push for speedier reform.
   Elections are scheduled for March in the Russian Federation, the
biggest of the Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics with some
150 million people and land stretching from the Baltic Sea to the
Pacific Ocean.
   The nomination process has just begun, and no other prominent
candidates for the presidency have been announced.
   The current Russian Federation president is Vitaly I.
Vorotnikov, the longest-standing member of the ruling Politburo
except Gorbachev.
