<HEAD>Tiny Film Production Company Settles Suit Against Kodak</HEAD>

   A small film company that makes videos
of the nation's top tourist attractions said Wednesday it had
settled a breach-of-contract lawsuit against a division of
photography giant Eastman Kodak Co.
   J.R. Johnson, a co-founder VideoTours, said the company had
agreed to drop its lawsuit against Kodak Programs Inc., Kodak's
home video division, in exchange for an undisclosed cash settlement.
   The agreement also calls for Kodak to cease marketing
VideoTours' tapes and pay certain royalties due its clients,
Johnson said.
   Kodak spokesman Paul Allen declined to discuss specifics of the
settlement, but said it meant the affiliation between the two
companies _ one with revenues of $17 billion, the other with sales
of $1 million _ was over.
   Glastonbury-based VideoTours produces videos of top tourist
attractions so viewers can ``visit'' the sites without leaving
their living rooms.
   VideoTours filed suit in U.S. District Court in Hartford in
October, alleging breach of contract in its distribution deal with
Kodak. The lawsuit sought more than $50,000 in damages.
   VideoTours charged that Kodak failed to help VideoTours market
and promote videos already produced and assist in financing
additional productions.
   It also charged that Kodak failed to pay royalties to VideoTours
clients, many of whom are non-profit institutions, monitor on-site
sales, refill inventories and maintain displays with zoos,
aquariums and museums where the tapes are sold.
   VideoTours, founded in 1986, has produced 13 videos featuring
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Old Sturbridge Village and Mystic
Seaport in Connecticut and other sites.
