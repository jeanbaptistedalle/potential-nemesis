   Most grain and soybean futures prices fell
slightly Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as badly needed
precipitation fell in U.S. winter wheat region and the Brazilian
soybean belt.
   In the Great Plains, the precipitation was in the form of snow,
which should help insulate the dormant winter wheat crop from the
brutal cold in the nation's midsection. The development was bearish
for new-crop wheat contracts, those for delivery next spring.
   In Brazil, where it's late springtime, weekend rains brought
relief to the soybean crop, which has been suffering through hot,
dry conditions. Brazil is the world's second-largest soybean
producer after the United States.
   Sub-zero temperatures in the Plains and Midwest helped support
the wheat and soybean markets last week. Temperatures have warmed
up slightly but are expected to plunge again before the weekend.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1\ cents lower to 2 cents
higher with December at $4.15 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1{
cents lower with December at $2.34{ a bushel; oats were 1{ cents to
2} cents lower with December at $1.42 a bushel; and soybeans were {
cent to 2{ cents lower with January at $5.81{ a bushel.
