   A man charged with murder for running
over an acquaintance with his car told police that the victim had
paid him to kill him.
   The victim, Graham Glickfeld, 31, of Fremont, paid Michael K.
Doeschot, 27, of Newark, to kill him in a community center parking
lot, police said Wednesday.
   ``It was a murder for hire,'' based on Doeschot's account, said
Sgt. Mike Eads.
   Doeschot was arraigned Wednesday on a charge of first-degree
murder. No bail was set at the hearing in Fremont-Newark-Union City
Municipal Court.
   Police refused to speculate on the motive for the alleged
agreement carried out Friday night.
   Doeschot, a San Jose State student, and Glickfeld, a supermarket
employee, attended a Christmas party with friends Friday evening,
police said.
   Shortly before midnight, police were called to the Fremont
Community Center, where they found Glickfeld lying in the empty
parking lot. Glickfeld, who had been run over by a small car, was
taken to Washington Hospital, where he died a short time later,
according to police.
   Doeschot later phoned Newark police ``to let us know what's
going on,'' Eads said. ``There was an admission that (Doeschot) had
run over this guy.''
   Officers stopped Doeschot at a grocery store and took him to the
police station.
   Eads would not say how much Glickfeld allegedly paid to be
killed but said it was ``not a lot of money.''
