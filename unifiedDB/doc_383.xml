   Martin Marietta Corp. will try again
tonight to conduct the thrice-delayed launch its first commerical
Titan 3 rocket with British and Japanese communications satellites.
   The flight was scrubbed Monday night just five minutes before
the planned liftoff when weather balloon data indicated winds
27,000 feet above the launch area were too strong.
   ``The winds aloft are not acceptable,'' launch commentator Bob
Gordon said in announcing the postponement.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:20 p.m. tonight. It was
postponed twice earlier this month by weather and technical
problems.
   The Titan 3 is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and the British Ministry of Defense.
   The Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British
government are sharing the $125 million cost of the rocket and
launch services provided by Martin Marietta.
