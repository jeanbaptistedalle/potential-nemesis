<TEXT>
   Walter Doane ``Bo'' Randall, renowned as
one of the world's best knife makers, is dead at age 80.
   Randall, who began hand-crafting hunting knives half a century
ago as a hobby, had an eight-man factory in Orlando that turned out
knives favored by the Army's Special Forces and military men and
civilians in many countries.
   Randall knives are displayed in the Smithsonian Institution and
the Museum of Special Warfare at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   Each Randall blade is made of ``the best high-carbon steel,
forged, ground, tempered and fitted to the hilt entirely by hand,''
said Harper's Magazine years ago.
   ``Although the demand is heavy _ his shop often has to backlog
orders for more than a year _ nobody has ever tried to compete with
him by mass-production methods.''
   The knife-collector's bible, American Knives, referred to
Randall as the world's greatest blade maker.
   Randall, born in Cincinnati, died Monday.
   Survivors include his wife Ruth, a son, two daughters, a brother
and 10 grandchildren.
