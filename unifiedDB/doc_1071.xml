   An Army soldier confiscated the tape of a TV
news agency cameraman who shot pictures Thursday of U.S. troops
surrounding the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City, the
agency's bureau chief here said.
   A complaint will be filed with the Pentagon, said Robert
Sullivan, bureau chief of Worldwide Television News. Based in
London, WTN is co-owned by ABC and includes ABC, CBS and CNN among
its clients.
   Sullivan said the WTN camerman, Alejandro Carbonnel, a
Panamanian, was shooting pictures when an U.S. Army sergeant
approached him and confiscated the cameraman's videotape.
   Carbonnel said the soldier gave no explanation other that the
cameraman ``had to have permission from the Southern Command to
shoot here,'' Sullivan said. He said the sergeant's indentity isn't
known..
   The Southern Command is the multi-service U.S. military command
running the military strike in Panama that was aimed at toppling
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The American troops in Panama City surrounded the Cuban and
Nicaruagan embassies there Thursday after rumors spread that
Noriega may have fled to one of the embassies during the U.S.
military invasion of his country.
   Carbonel was among the press corps in Panama when the invasion
began Wednesday. He is not part of the Pentagon press pool flown
there. NBC correspondent Fred Francis is the pool's correspondent
for the major networks.
