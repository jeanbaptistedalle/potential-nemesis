   Knight-Ridder Inc. announced the promotion of Tally
Liu to vice president and controller, succeeding Phillip M. Kane.
   Liu, 39, succeeds Kane, a 15-year veteran of the company who was
leaving Knight-Ridder to pursue other interests, according to a
company statement released Thursday. Liu's new position is
effective Feb. 2, 1990.
   Liu, who has been chief financial officer of the chain's San
Jose Mercury News in California since 1986, will report in his new
position to Larry Levine, Knight-Ridder treasurer and vice
president for finance.
   ``Tally Liu is one of our very brightest financial executives,''
Senior Vice President Robert F. Singleton said in announcing the
appointment. ``His performance has been outstanding in every
assignment he has undertaken.''
   Liu is a certified public accountant who joined Knight-Ridder in
1978 as a financial officer at the Boca Raton (Fla.) News. He
transferred to San Jose in 1983.
   Liu was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1976. A
graduate of national Chen-Chi University of Taiwan, he also has an
MBA degree from Florida Atlantic University and is working towards
a doctorate in business administration at Nova University in Fort
Lauderdale, the statement said.
