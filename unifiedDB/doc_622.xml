   International Business Machines Corp.
on Tuesday announced a partnership with a small software company
that will allow IBM's OfficeVision software to connect with office
software systems of other manufacturers.
   Under the agreement, Soft-Switch, of Wayne, Pa., has designed
software that will allow companies using OfficeVision to exchange
computer documents and electronic mail with office systems made by
Digital Equipment Corp., Wang Laboratories Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and others, IBM said.
   OfficeVision, introduced by IBM in May, allows companies using
various IBM computers of different sizes to tie them together in
one system. The software overcomes the incompatibility of many IBM
products, a shortfall that has been exploited by Digital and other
companies that make only compatible machines.
   The Soft-Switch products will be sold by both IBM and
Soft-Switch. They will be available Dec. 29 and will be priced from
$40,000 to $250,000, IBM said.
   Separately Tuesday, IBM introduced the most powerful member of
its Personal System-2 computer family, a model based on Intel
Corp.'s i486 microprocessor. The model, called the PS-2 Model 70
486, is priced at $12,395 and up.
   In addition, IBM said it would resume shipping a kit to upgrade
its earlier PS-2 Model 70 computers by adding the i486 chip. IBM
stopped shipping the kits in October after Intel alerted it to a
flaw in the chips. The trouble was corrected with a new version of
the microprocessor.
