   A fare told cabbie Carl Olson Jr. to wait
for him when he was dropped off at the First American Bank, saying
he was just going to rob it and be right out.
   ``Meet me a little later ... I'm going to rob a bank,'' the
thief told Olson, according to police.
   A man took $10,000 from the bank at about 12:50 p.m. Friday.
   Police, alerted by Olson, arrived moments later, according to
Detective Capt. Vincent Foley.
   Though the robber had already disappeared, the robbery was
recorded by bank security cameras. Albany detectives and FBI agents
said Friday they were searching for Arthur J. DeLorenzo, 29, of
Schenectady, for questioning in the robbery.
   The robber didn't have a weapon, police said.
