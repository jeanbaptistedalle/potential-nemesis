   Workers pulled two more bodies Tuesday out of the
charred remains of a downtown rooming house that was set on fire
over the weekend, bringing the death toll to six.
   The blaze occurred Saturday after a pile of garbage was set on
fire in a hallway, causing about $600,000 damage to the building.
   Police have charged a Toronto man with three counts of
second-degree murder. Gordon Freeman, 49, is to appear in
provincial court Wednesday.
   Police constable Bill Thomson said police will file further
charges after they are certain there are no more bodies.
   The 60 residents left homeless by the fire were given turkey
dinners at a Salvation Army shelter Christmas Day. Spokesman Harold
Zimmerman said the Salvation Army will help them find permanent
homes later this week.
