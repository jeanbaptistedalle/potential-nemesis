<HEAD>Forest Agency Turns to Goats to Control Vegetation</HEAD>

   The U.S. Forest Service will try using
goats instead of herbicides to control vegetation in the Ouachita
National Forest.
   Fifty billy goats will graze on 20 acres in the first year of
the four-year project on the north side of the Blue Ouachita
Mountain near the north fork of the Ouachita River. The goats will
graze annually from April to October.
   Using goats has ``the connotation of being a little bit weird
and off-the-wall idea,'' said Jerry Ingersoll, forester for the
Jessieville Ranger District. ``And it's certainly got some risk
involved. We don't know whether or not it will work, really.''
   Among the unknown factors, he said, is whether the goats will
eat only the hardwoods and leave the pines.
   Ingersoll is part of a Forest Service team that will oversee the
project, a joint effort with the American Institute for Goat
Research at Langston University in Oklahoma.
   Dogs will protect the goats, all castrated adults, from
predators and an electric fence will keep them within the area.
