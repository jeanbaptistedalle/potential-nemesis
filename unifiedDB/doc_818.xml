<HEAD>Smithsonian Says 11 Scientists, Technicians Missing</HEAD>

   The Smithsonian Institution reported Wednesday
that 11 scientists and technicians associated with the its Tropical
Research Institute in Panama are missing and are believed to have
been abducted.
   ``These people have disappeared, and we're very concerned,''
said Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs. ``We have every
reason to believe they were taken hostage.''
   Ms. Jacobs said the scientists, five Americans, five Panamanians
and one Venezuelan, were working at a marine research facility on
the Sanblas chain of islands off the Panamanian coast in the
Caribbean when they were abducted by armed troops.
   A Smithsonian employee on the island called the research
institute's director in Panama City at midmorning by radio
telephone to warn that the troops were approaching in a boat. A
couple of hours later, a technician on the island called briefly to
say they were being transferred to the mainland and taken by truck
to an unknown destination.
   Ms. Jacobs said most of the 190 other Smithsonian employees and
visiting scientists in Panama had been accounted for.
