   A Michigan ski area shut down Tuesday
after a 6-year-old boy apparently was strangled in a ski-lift
mechanism.
   Anthony Ryan Mazzali of La Porte, Texas, visiting relatives with
his parents, died Saturday at Munising's city-owned Maple Mountain
Ski Hill on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, police Chief Douglas Miron
said Tuesday.
   Don Fahrbach, the Alger County medical examiner who handled
boy's autopsy, said Anthony apparently died of strangulation after
his clothing became caught in the lift machinery. Fahrbach said
tests to confirm the cause of death were due back later this week.
   Miron said it was the first time anyone had been killed or
seriously injured at the ski hill. The resort, which is privately
managed for the city, had been closed for Christmas and remained
closed Tuesday, officials said.
