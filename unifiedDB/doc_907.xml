   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by moderate
losses in the soybean market linked in part to the closing of the
Panama Canal.
   But Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the decline in soybean prices mostly
represented a continuation of a seasonal trend.
   Trading activity was very light, with many traders getting an
early start on the holiday weekend.
   The Panama Canal was closed to traffic Wednesday as U.S. armed
forces launched a surprise assault in Panama in an attempt to
capture Panamian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Shipments of U.S. soybeans to Japan pass through the Panama
Canal. But Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the closing of the canal was ``a pretty minor
factor'' in the market's decline.
   ``It certainly is premature to think any serious or permanent
export disruption would be caused by it,'' she said.
   Soybean prices had slipped lower in the two previous trading
sessions.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.13\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats
were { cent to } cent lower with March at $1.52 a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with January at $5.74\ a bushel.
