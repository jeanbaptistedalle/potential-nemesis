   Two former Jim Bakker associates accused
of lying to a grand jury have been released on $25,000 bond pending
their trials.
   Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher, whose introduction of Jessica
Hahn to Bakker led to the scandal that destroyed the television
ministry, and the Rev. Sam Johnson, former pastor of the Heritage
Church at PTL, were both released following a brief hearing
Wednesday.
   Fletcher is accused of lying to a grand jury about why he
introduced Ms. Hahn to Bakker in 1980, and Johnson is accused of
lying to the same grand jury about the source of a $10,000 loan he
made to one of Bakker's aides that eventually was given to Ms. Hahn.
   Johnson's arraignment was scheduled for Jan. 16.
   Fletcher appeared without an attorney before U.S. Magistrate
Paul Taylor, who imposed several conditions for his release,
including surrendering his passport and refraining from the use of
alcohol and narcotics.
   Fletcher recently was arrested twice in one night in Durham on
charges of driving while impaired.
   ``My life has been in such shambles these past three years,''
Fletcher said as he left the federal courthouse in downtown
Charlotte.
   Taylor said he would appoint counsel for Fletcher after the
evangelist told the magistrate: ``I have nothing, sir, except the
clothes on my back.''
   Taylor did not schedule Fletcher's arraignment because he said
it will take about a week to appoint counsel.
   Johnson faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each
of 12 perjury counts. Fletcher could face the same sentence on one
perjury count.
