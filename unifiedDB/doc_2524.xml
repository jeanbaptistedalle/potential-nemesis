<HEAD>College Student's Death During Arrest Ruled a Homicide</HEAD>

   The death of a college student who died after
he was arrested outside a Grateful Dead rock concert was homicide
because he was choked while officers wrestled him down, coroner's
officials said.
   Patrick Shanahan, 19, of Fountain Valley was high on the
hallucinogenic drug LSD but died outside the concert in suburban
Inglewood earlier this month from ``compression of the neck during
restraint,'' according to a Los Angeles County coroner's autopsy
report released Thursday.
   ``It's not an accident, not a suicide, it's a homicide _ meaning
death at the hands of another,'' said coroner's investigator David
Campbell.
   The district attorney's office is investigating and there is a
possibility of criminal charges, spokesman Mike Botula said
Thursday.
   ``It might be that even though there was the death of a suspect
involved, the police may have acted properly,'' Botula said.
   Witnesses reported seeing Inglewood police officers beating
Shanahan with night sticks during his arrest after a Dec. 10
concert. The officers said they approached Shanahan because he was
crawling on his hands and knees and screaming.
   Inglewood police refused to comment on the coroner's ruling
Thursday. Previously, police denied that officers either struck
Shanahan or used excessive force, saying he resisted arrest and
probably died from a drug overdose.
   Shanahan, a student at the University of California, Santa
Barbara, stopped breathing after six officers placed him in a
patrol car, Inglewood police said. He was pronounced dead at a
hospital.
