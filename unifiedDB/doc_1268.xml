   Romanian state radio on Friday broadcast
a declaration to its people, declaring ``We won'' after East bloc
agencies reported that the army and anti-government protesters had
united to overthrow President Nicolae Ceausescu, the harsh ruler of
Romania for 24 years.
   The Communist leader was reported preparing to flee the country,
Romanian emigres said.
   Demonstrators who took part in anti-government marches marched
on the radio, which broadcast their declaration, ``Our beloved
Romanians, we are coming now from the center of the capital. We
must take our fate in our hands.''
   Widespread unrest began over the weekend in the western city of
Timosoara and spread to other cities after troops fired on
demonstrators, killing hundreds of people.
