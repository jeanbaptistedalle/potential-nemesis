<HEAD>Money Magazine Says Small Investors' Holdings Grew 200 Percent in
1980s</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The investment portfolio of the average small
investor tripled in the 1980s, aided by the booming stock market,
according to an index compiled by Money magazine.
   The magazine said its Small Investor Index grew 200.5 percent
during the decade.
   At that rate, holdings worth $14,791 on Dec. 31, 1979, grew by
the end of 1989 to $44,439, which the magazine says is the size of
the typical individual investor's portfolio today. The index
assumes that all earnings were reinvested.
   The gain for the decade was equivalent to an 11.6 percent annual
return, compared with a 6 percent return during the 1970s, Money
said. After inflation, which averaged 5.1 percent a year in the
1980s, investors saw real annual profits of 6.5 percent. During the
1970s, they actually lost 1.3 percent a year after inflation, the
magazine says.
   The growth of investment portfolios in the 1980s resulted
primarily from the longest bull market in stocks since the 1950s,
Money says.
   Small investors also benefitted from the boom in money-market
mutual funds, which allowed them to earn two to four percentage
points more on their cash than in the 1970s, when they generally
kept cash in low-yielding passbook savings accounts.
   For 1989, small investors saw their portfolios increase by 14.5
percent on average, according to the Money index. Again, much of
the increase was due to the runup in stocks.
