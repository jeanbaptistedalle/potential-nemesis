   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, will
journey to Boston on Tuesday to attend the funeral of their
brother-in-law, Alexander Ellis II, the White House said Sunday.
   Ellis died Friday of a stroke following intestinal surgery. The
67-year-old insurance executive was the husband of the president's
sister, Nancy Walker Bush Ellis.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters of the
Bushes' decision aboard Air Force One as the president flew here
from Houston to visit soldiers wounded in Panama.
   He said former President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
called the Bushes on Saturday to express their condolences.
   The president has been in Texas since Wednesday on a five-day,
year-end vacation.
   Bush is scheduled to return to the White House on Monday night
after stopping in Montgomery, Ala., to go bass fishing on New
Year's Day on his way home from Houston.
   The White House had no immediate details on what time Bush would
fly to Boston on Tuesday.
