   Actor Daniel Day-Lewis says that confining
himself to a wheelchair for the six weeks of filming ``My Left
Foot'' was necessary in portraying disabled Irish artist Christy
Brown.
   ``I took the liberty of thinking that it was imperative to do it
this way and did not think about any inconvenience I might have
caused because, in the end, it was beneficial to show the people on
the set what we were trying to do,'' he said.
   Day-Lewis remained in the wheelchair even during breaks,
communicating only with grunts and requiring aides to feed and
carry him.
   Brown, who died in 1981, was written off by doctors as a mental
defective but later rose to prominence as a writer and painter. The
cerebral palsy victim used his left foot, his only controllable
limb.
   In researching Brown's life, Day-Lewis said he learned that
Brown never considered himself handicapped and wanted desperately
to be considered normal.
   ``He has unwillingly become a spokesman for the disabled,''
Day-Lewis said, ``and he probably is the worst person in the world
to be a spokesman. He ... had an overwhelming sense of his own
disabilities. I don't think he ever came to terms with it.''
