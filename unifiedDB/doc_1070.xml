   A storage tank leaked at a chemical
plant Thursday, sending up a stinging, toxic cloud of acid that
drifted over the Swiss-French border, authorities said.
   Residents were warned to close windows and stay indoors for more
than an hour as the cigar-shaped cloud, about 1,000 yards long,
drifted toward France.
   The chlorosulfonic acid, which is used in the manufacture of
dyes, leaked from a tank at Ciba-Geigy, Switzerland's largest
chemical company.
   Four workers and eight residents were treated for irritated eyes
and coughing; two of these were hospitalized.
   Chlorosulfonic acid can cause lung injuries if inhaled for some
time.
   The accident occurred while the acid was being pumped from a
railway tanker into a storage tank, the company said.
   Special fire brigades from Ciba Geigy and nearby companies would
remain on the site until the over-filled storage tank was safely
emptied.
   The accident set off the biggest alarm in the Basel region since
a 1986 toxic spill in the Rhine River caused one of Europe's worst
environmental disasters.
