<HEAD>Uzbek Ex-Communist Party Chief Gets 12 Years for Bribe-Taking</HEAD>

   The former president and later Communist Party
chief of Soviet Uzbekistan drew 12 years in prison Wednesday for
bribe-taking in a scandal that touched many officials in the
Central Asian republic, Tass said. The court also ordered an
investigation into the prosecution's action in arresting relatives
of the defendant, Inamzhon Usmankhodzhayev.
   The Uzbek was found guilty of accepting $82,100 in bribes
``discrediting state and party bodies, and severely damaging the
interests of the state and society,'' the Soviet news agency
reported. All his property was confiscated.
   He was party first secretary from 1983 to January 1988, when he
retired on a pension. Prior to that, he was president of Uzbekistan
for five years.
   Prosecutors Telman Gdlyan and Nikolai Ivanov became instant
celebrities when they said their Uzbek corruption probe reached
into the ruling Politburo.
   But the two then were themselves accused of forcing confessions
and other improprities in their investigations. The public rallied
around the two prosecutors during the scandal.
   Both prosecutors are now members of parliament and no charges
have been filed against them.
   Tass described the scene outside the Moscow courtroom as
tumultous after the court's rulings Wednesday.
   ``Gdlyan and Ivanov should have sat on that (defendants') bench!
They held us in prison,'' cried Usmankhodzhayev's sister, Maryam,
according to Tass.
   Usmankhodzhayev tried to recant his confession, saying it was
made under duress, but the court rejected his claim.
