   Leftist rebels said Friday they
would observe a cease-fire for the Christmas holidays, and the
government promised to lift a curfew imposed because of the latest
guerrilla offensive.
   A statement from the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front said it would stop fighting from Saturday, Dec. 23, through
Jan. 2 so Salvadorans could enjoy the holidays in peace.
   It also said, without elaboration, that the guerrillas had asked
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to reopen a
process of real negotiations to end the war.''
   President Alfredo Cristiani's government said the 11 p.m.-5 a.m.
curfew would end on Christmas Eve.
   The curfew was imposed in November after the rebels began their
most intense and prolonged attack of the 10-year-old war, bringing
the battle to San Salvador for most of the month.
