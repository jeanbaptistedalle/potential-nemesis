<HEAD>First Consumer Goods Since February Reach Hungry Southern City</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents of an isolated southern city
gave a jubilant welcome to a convoy of barges that arrived with the
first consumer goods in 10 months, the Sudan News Agency reported
Sunday.
   The barges' military escort repelled an attack by the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army as it snaked along the Nile to reach
Malakal, 425 miles south of the capital, Khartoum.
   The agency did not say when the barges arrived. It said they
carried 45,000 tons of sorghum, sugar, cooking oil and laundry soap.
   The city's 100,000 people have faced severe shortages as a
result of fighting between government troops and southern rebels.
The fighting forced the government to suspend relief flights to the
region, and the last commercial barge to reach the city arrived in
February.
   SUNA said the convoy had an army unit guarding it on board and
another walking alongside it on the shore. It left Khartoum on Dec.
4.
