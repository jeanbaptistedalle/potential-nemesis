<HEAD>Soviet Rocket Carrying U.S. Experiment Blasts Off for the Mir</HEAD>

   A Soviet rocket blasted off today carrying the
first U.S. scientific experiment to the Mir space station.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the Progress M-2
cargo rocket lifted off on schedule at 6:31 a.m. and was
functioning normally. It is scheduled to dock with the Mir in two
days.
   Along with food, water and 90 pounds of New Year's presents for
two Soviet cosmonauts on the Mir, the rocket carries an experiment
for growing protein crystals in space, developed by Payload Systems
of Cambridge, Mass.
   Flights of the U.S. space shuttle are too short to grow many
kinds of crystals, whereas on Mir, the Soviet orbital platform
launched in February 1986, they would have months to develop. Such
research has applications in the development of pharmaceutical
products and the improvement of existing drugs.
   The crystal-growing experiment is to begin aboard Mir on Dec. 25
and run for 56 days. It will be returned to Earth Feb. 24 in a
Soyuz-TM capsule.
