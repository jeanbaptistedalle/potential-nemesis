   Actor Kevin Costner is ``the man for the
'90s'' with his natural, sexy looks, and ``Nightline'' host Ted
Koppel's talent and fairness make him one of the year's most
watchable people, a women's group said.
   Actors Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, basketball
star Magic Johnson and talk show host Arsenio Hall joined Costner
and Koppel on ManWatchers Inc.'s list of the Ten Most Watchable
People of 1989, announced Sunday.
   Rounding out the group for the first time were three women:
actress Michele Pfeiffer, first lady Barbara Bush and ``Today''
co-host Jane Pauley.
   ``This year we included women in our list of famous people who
are deserving of compliments,'' ManWatchers President Suzy Mallery
said. ``Looks are much less important than they used to be;
accomplishment, creativity, kindness and manners count much more.''
   Still, the group knows a hunk when it sees one. ``You are the
man of the '90s, or what we hope the man of the '90s will be like:
natural, comfortably masculine and sexy,'' it said of Costner.
   As for Nicholson, ``You're not getting older, you're getting
much better.''
   Manwatchers said Pfeiffer represents ``what many of today's
women would like to be: beautiful, bright and successful.'' The
group also said it admired the first lady's ``accomplishments,
warmth and naturalness of appearance.''
