   Argentina and Britain resumed
consular ties on Thursday after a nearly eight-year gap that dated
back to the Falkland Islands War.
   Alan Hunt presented his credentials to the Foreign Ministry and
was accepted as Britain's consul. A similar ceremony took place in
London, where Santos Goni was accredited as the Argentine consul.
   Since the 1982 war, which Argentina launched to recover
territory in the South Atlantic it has claimed since the last
century, each country has maintained only an interest section in
the other: Argentina at Brazil's embassy in London, Britain at the
Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires.
   Consular flags will be hoisted in London and Buenos Aires on
Friday.
   The way was paved for a thaw in relations by the election of
Carlos Menem as Argentina's president last May. Menem dropped the
government's previous insistence that ownership of the Falklands be
an issue in any bilateral talks.
   The countries have agreed to resume air and maritime
communications and lift all remaining commercial and financial
restrictions and restrictive practices imposed since 1982.
   They also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects their
respective claims to sovereignty over the islands, which are
inhabited by 1,800 people, mostly British descendants.
   A further meeting in February is expected to lead to resumption
of full diplomatic relations.
   Buenos Aires surrendered to a British task force on June 14,
1982, 74 days after invading the South Atlantic archipelago.
