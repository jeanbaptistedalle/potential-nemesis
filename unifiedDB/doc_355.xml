   Honda of America on Monday began mass
production of Civics at its new plant, a 1.4 million-square-foot
operation in west-central Ohio about five miles from the
automaker's first assembly plant at Marysville.
   The Japanese-owned company, now the fourth-largest automaker in
the United States, said it will make 65,000 cars at the new plant
next year. In 1991, the company expects the plant to produce
150,000 cars, bringing Honda's total auto production in Ohio to
510,00 Accords and Civics that year.
   The Marysville plant, about 3.1 million square feet, also makes
Civic four-door sedans, as well as Accord four-door sedans and
two-door coupes. It produces 360,000 cars a year.
   Honda said the $380 million East Liberty plant has 450 employees
working one shift during the remaining five days of production this
year. At full production, the plant will have about 1,800 employees
on two shifts.
   The company said the plant will help meet its production needs
for exporting cars. Honda plans to increase exports to Japan and
other countries from about 12,000 cars this year to 70,000 in the
early 1990s.
