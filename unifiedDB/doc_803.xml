   One of 37 soldiers wounded in the U.S.
attack in Panama died after arriving today at a military hospital,
a hospital spokesman said.
   The soldier, who was not identified, died at the Air Force's
Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base, said
spokesman George Kelling.
   Kelling did not identify the soldier or disclose the nature of
the injuries.
   The soldiers arrived at Kelly Air Force Base about 11:45 a.m.
and were taken to the hospital, Airman Cynthia Fontenot said
earlier.
   She would not say how many casualties were taken to the hospital
or how serious their injuries were.
   Ray Dery, spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio, said doctors there were standing in case they were needed
at Wilford Hall.
   Officials in Washington said 11 American servicemen were killed,
one was missing and 59 wounded in the fighting. One U.S. civilian,
a woman, also was reported slain.
