   Allegheny International Inc. reported Thursday
that its net loss nearly tripled in its fiscal fourth quarter from
a year earlier.
   The small-appliance maker said it posted a net loss of $36.7
million, or $4.06 a share, in the three months ended Oct. 1,
widened from a loss of $12.4 million, or $1.84 a share, a year
earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $207.4 million from $222.9
million.
   Allegheny International has operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for around two years. Earlier this month, a federal
judge approved a $6.25 million settlement of shareholders' lawsuits
from 1986 that accused some officers and directors of violating
securities laws.
   Minneapolis financier Irwin L. Jacobs, once the largest
shareholder in the company, recently sold all of his remaining
shares.
   The company said the latest fourth-quarter results included
charges of $21.1 million for plant rationalization, business
restructuring and product writeoff costs. The same period a year
earlier included $9.3 million in charges.
   For the fiscal year ended Oct. 1, Allegheny International posted
a net loss of $54.9 million, or $7.80 a share, compared with a loss
of $25.1 million, or $5.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue declined to $937.6 million from $967.8 million.
