   A couple had declared their acre of land to
be without a county, but a federal judge says otherwise and now
they face the inevitable _ a $1,200 bill for back taxes.
   But Tom and Brenda Norton still haven't taken down their
hand-painted sign that reads ``Lost County. Pop. 2.''
   The Nortons bought the land from Mrs. Norton's uncle in 1986 and
paid property taxes to Jasper County. After they started a building
for their family business, Jasper County officials discovered the
land was in Newton County.
   They filed a lawsuit in 1987.
   Norton refused to pay Newton County taxes on the land for the
past three years because of the dispute. Now, county officials say
he owes $1,200.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining last week granted the
counties' request to end the matter. Officials said an independent
survey last year determined that the property was part of Newton
County in southwestern Georgia.
