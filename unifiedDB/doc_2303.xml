   Staff at a plush restaurant found
themselves serving turkey on a silver platter to a dog whose name
was chosen in a raffle over hundreds of human contestants.
   The cocker spaniel, appropriately named Lucky, was entered in
the competition by his owner, Phyllis Walmsley, of Shanklin, on the
Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast.
   Hundreds of people entered the raffle organized by the 1st
Shanklin Scouts group, but Lucky was the winner of the first prize
of a Christmas meal at a top restaurant on the island.
   Alan Priddle, owner of the Cottage Restaurant, said Thursday he
settled Lucky down at a table with a platter of turkey on Dec. 18.
The restaurant owner skipped the potatoes and turnip.
   ``We thought we'd just stick to the meat,'' Priddle said. ``He
ate all the turkey, yes.''
   He added: ``The dog was very well behaved. The only time he
growled was when we tried to put a party hat on his head.''
   Mrs. Walmsley said: ``I only entered Lucky for a joke, but he
lived up to his name.''
