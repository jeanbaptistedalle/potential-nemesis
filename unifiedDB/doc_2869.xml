   Inspectors were at an Aspen ski resort
Sunday to determine why a chairlift slid 35 feet backward, causing
five skiers to fall or jump to the ground and leaving 200 others
stranded.
   A 14-year-old Evergreen girl broke her back in Saturday's
accident at the Buttermilk ski resort and remained hospitalized,
authorities said.
   Four people were treated for minor injuries. Three of the
stranded skiers were treated for hypothermia and released.
   The cable on the mile-long lift slid 35 feet in eight seconds
before an emergency brake caught hold, Aspen Skiing Co. officials
said.
   Some of the stranded skiers were stuck aloft for up to two hours
as ski patrol members evacuated the lift, using ladders and a T-bar
attached to a hand-held rope, officials said.
   Resort officials did not know how far the skiers fell because
the height varies as the chair moves up the mountain. They said
none of the drops was major.
   It was the first chairlift accident at Buttermilk since the ski
area opened in 1958, said Terri Hart-Roberts, an Aspen Skiing Co.
spokeswoman. The lift, built and installed in 1969 by Herron Poma,
is a fixed-grip chairlift, a common design in which each chair is
permanently attached to the lift cable.
