   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said Wednesday that
Michael A. Miles had been elected as a vice chairman and a director
of the food, tobacco and brewing giant and chairman of its biggest
division, Kraft General Foods.
   Miles' election to the posts had been expected in the wake of
the announcement Sept. 27 that John M. Richman planned to retire
from those posts at the end of the year.
   Miles, 50, has been president and chief executive of Kraft
General Foods, the maker of products such as Miracle Whip salad
dressing, Velveeta cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O desserts
and Oscar Mayer meats.
   The company expects the foods business will account for more
than half the corporation's revenues of about $45 million this year.
   Philip Morris' other divisions are the Philip Morris USA tobacco
company and Miller Brewing Co.
   With Miles' election to the board, the board expands to 22
directors from 21. The company has two vice chairmen _ the other is
R. William Murray.
   Philip Morris' chairman and chief executive is Hamish Maxwell
and its president is John A. Murphy.
   Miles joined Kraft Inc. as president and chief operating officer
in 1982 and stayed on in those posts after Philip Morris acquired
Kraft in late 1988.
   He has previously been senior vice president of foods at
Heublein Inc. and was chairman of what was then Heublein's Kentucky
Fried Chicken Corp.
   Before joining Heublein in 1971, Miles worked for 10 years with
the advertising agency Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
