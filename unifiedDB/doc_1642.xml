   Ernest Dutch Morial, New Orleans's first
black mayor, died early Sunday, apparently of a heart attack. He
was 60.
   Morial was found slumped over the steering wheel of his car on
Lakeshore Parkway, where he had been visiting a friend, at 11 p.m.
Saturday, said Jinx Broussard, a spokeswoman for Mayor Sidney
Barthelemy.
   Morial was taken to Mercy Hospital where efforts to revive him
failed, Broussard said.
   Morial was mayor of New Orleans for two terms from 1978-1986.
   He not only was the city's first black mayor, but from 1967-1970
he was the first black to serve in the state Legislature since
Reconstruction. Prior to that he was a U.S. attorney. From
1973-1977, he was a judge on the Louisiana 4th Circuit Court of
Appeals.
