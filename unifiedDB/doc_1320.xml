<TEXT>
   William C. Greenough, developer of the
variable-annuity pension and one-time head of the biggest pension
fund in the United States, has died of complications from a heart
attack. He was 75.
   Greenough died Wednesday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center.
   The Indiana-born and -educated economist was president and then
chairman of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College
Retirement Equities Fund from 1957 until his retirement in 1979.
The $82 billion fund covers more than a million educators and
administrators in 4,300 institutions.
   Greenough put forward the idea of a variable-annuity stock fund
in the early 1950s when he was vice president of the fund. The
approach was based on his perception that over the long run a
diverse portfolio of common stocks would outperform traditional
fixed-dollar pensions.
   Greenough was a director of the New York Stock Exchange for 10
years beginning in 1972 and in 1979 served on President Carter's
Commission on Pension Policy.
   Greenough is survived by his wife, Doris; two sons, David, of
Downington, Pa., and Walter, of Chicago, and a daughter, Martha
Alice.
   A service will be held Jan. 12 in All-Souls Unitarian Church.
