   A car struck by a hit-and-run driver ran up on a
sidewalk, killing an unrelated woman and child and injuring two
others, police said.
   Ma Kit Ching, 52, and Hector Hernandez, 9, were killed in the
Tuesday afternoon accident. The child's mother, Yvonne Orive, 35,
was in critical condition at Maimonides Medical Center, said Sgt.
Ed Burns, a police spokesman.
   Catacutan Kit, 8, also was in critical condition at Maimonides.
Ms. Ching and Catacutan apparently were not related, Burns said.
   The driver of the car that hit the four Brooklyn pedestrians was
not charged, Burns said. The other driver was being sought.
