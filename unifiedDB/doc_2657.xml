   Grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed
Friday in a shortened trading session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading conditions were thin ahead of the New Year's weekend.
The markets closed at noon CST, 75 minutes earlier than usual.
   Old-crop contracts, those for delivery through next summer, were
little changed or lower while manyof the new-crop contracts rose
moderately as traders began to think about the 1990 growing season,
said Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago.
   He said current stocks of grains and soybeans are more than
adequate and there is no danger of supply tightness.
   But any adverse weather beginning next spring could affect next
year's crops, Gustafson said. And with this winter starting out as
a hard one, some traders already are anticipating crop difficulties
in the new year.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent to 3 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to
1{ cents higher with March at $2.39} a bushel; oats were \ cent to
{ cents lower with March at $1.53{ a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents
lower to 2{ cents higher with January at $5.68 a bushel.
