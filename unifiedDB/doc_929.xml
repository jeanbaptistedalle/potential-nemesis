   TLC Beatrice International Inc., a food company
controlled by investor Reginald F. Lewis, said Tuesday it had
scrapped plans to sell a 35 percent stake to the public.
   The company cited unfavorable stock market conditions for
abandoning the plan, which was intended to raise as much as $194
million.
   Lewis said the offer might have been poorly timed.
   ``The time of the year and the market conditions right now were
both factors,'' he told The New York Times. ``Also, my sense is
that there is now not much awareness in the institutional investor
community about what is going on in Europe, or our company and how
it fit into the picture in Europe.''
   The underwriters of the proposed offering, Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, also advised TLC Beatrice to withdraw the offer, the
company said.
   The offering would have made TLC Beatrice the first
black-controlled company on the New York Stock Exchange. It also
would have left Lewis with 58 percent of the shares. He now has 55
percent.
   Lewis created the company by acquiring the international
operations of the former Beatrice Cos. for $985 million in 1987.
