<HEAD>Dresser Industries Calls Off $620 Million Smith International Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dresser Industries Inc. has called off its $620
million offer for Smith International Inc., a Houston drill bit
manufacturer, but the oil services company said it is pursuing an
alternate transaction.
   In a one-paragraph news release on Thursday, Dallas-based
Dresser said it was terminating the merger. No details were
provided in the release about the alternative being considered and
company officials declined to elaborate.
   When first announced in November, the companies said the deal
was contingent upon approval by shareholders and federal antitrust
regulators.
   Smith is the nation's second largest drill bit manufacturer and
Dresser is No. 4. Some analysts speculated the Federal Trade
Commission had expressed opposition to the transaction, which would
have put 45 percent of the nation's drill bit industry in one
company.
   Other analysts suggested Smith management may have decided to
remain independent, or had found a better deal than the complicated
Dresser cash, securities and debt-assumption offer.
   Yet others suggested Dresser had uncovered troubling information
in its review of Smith's finances.
   Dresser had sought to buy Smith to broaden its base in the
exploration and production side of the oil business, especially
Smith's expertise in horizontal drilling, considered an important
technique in the reviving industry.
