   Twelve people were killed and 12
injured when an apartment building collapsed under the weight of
three stories that were added to the structure illegally, police
said today.
   Rescue workers ended their search early today after pulling the
last four bodies from the rubble, police said.
   The building, which collapsed late Friday night, was inspected
recently after cracks appeared in some of its walls, residents
said. The government architect who examined the cracks did not
condemn the building, they said.
   The six-story building, located in the middle-class residential
district of Glim, originally had three stories, police said. But
they said its owners added another three stories without obtaining
building permits.
   ``The foundations of the house, designed to support only three
stories, apparently could not withstand the weight of another
three,'' said a police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   It was not known when the three additional floors were added.
   The fatalities included a family of four related to the
landlord, two 2-year-old children, a man and his wife, two women
and two Jordanian students.
   Police said people living in six of the apartment house's 10
units were traveling at the time of the collapse.
