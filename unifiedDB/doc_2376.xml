<HEAD>Seoul Agrees To Bear Costs To Relocate U.S. Military Facilities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea agreed in principle to
bear the estimated $3 billion needed to relocate all U.S. military
facilities out of Seoul, the Yonhap News Agency reported Friday,
quoting government sources.
   It said a final decision will be made at U.S.-Korean talks in
February.
   U.S. military spokesman Bill Fullerton declined to comment but
noted that Gen. Louis C. Menetrey, the top U.S. military commander
here, expressed hope on several occasions that the Seoul government
would cover all relocation costs.
   Both countries have been discussing the relocation after
agreeing in principle on moving all U.S. military facilities out of
the capital by 1996, including an 18-hole golf course.
   The facilities consist mainly of army headquarters and support
units in Yongsan, covering 670 acres. Many Koreans say the location
hampers city development.
   Yonhap said the facilities will be relocated in Taejon in
central South Korea instead of Osan, originally suggested by the
American side.
   About 43,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea under a 1954 mutual
defense treaty.
