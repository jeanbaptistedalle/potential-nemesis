   USX Corp. said Thursday it has signed a letter
of intent to sell property at its former USS Texas Works in Texas
to a joint venture.
   The sale of the former steel plant in Baytown, Texas, would
involve equipment, various buildings and more than 2,000 acres of
land, USX Chairman Charles Corry said in a written statement.
   The purchasing group will include Birmingham Steel Corp. of
Birmingham, Ala., and Proler International Corp. of Houston.
   Terms of the transaction, expected to be completed by June 15,
were not disclosed.
   Texas Works began operations in 1970 and produced steel products
until closing in July 1986. About 800 people were employed at the
plant when it was closed.
