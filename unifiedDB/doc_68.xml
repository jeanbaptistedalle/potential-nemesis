   A skydiver died Sunday when he, his son and
others leaped from a building more than 40 stories high in a
parachuting sport called base jumping, a police official said.
   Richard A. Pedley, 57, of Walnut leaped from the building in the
Century City neighborhood around 1:30 a.m. along with four or five
other people, said police Sgt. Curt Hussey.
   Pedley's parachute either became snagged or tangled on the
building, and he plunged into a nearby construction site.
   Pedley was flown to the University of California-Los Angeles
Medical Center, where he died later in the morning, Hussey said.
   Pedley's 22-year-old son, Richard A. Pedley Jr., stayed at the
site and was cited for trespassing. The other skydivers fled before
police arrived, Hussey said.
   Base jumping is done from fixed objects, either manmade or
natural, such as sheer cliff faces or bridges over deep ravines. A
clandestine activity in most instances, base jumpers usually make
their attempts at odd hours.
