   The U.S. government Monday quadrupled _ to $2
million _ the maximum reward it can offer to anyone who provides
information that helps thwart an act of terrorism.
   The money can be paid to ``any person who furnishes information
that leads to the prevention, frustration or favorable resolution
of a terrorist act against U.S. persons or property,'' the State
Department said in a brief announcement.
   The increase was made possible by a provision in an anti-drug
bill passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bush last
week. Rewards had been limited to $500,000.
   ``We believe this increase will strengthen U.S. efforts to
prevent terrorist attacks and will help bring terrorists to
justice,'' the statement said.
   Anyone with information about planned terrorist acts should call
the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate if they are overseas, or
contact the FBI if they are in the United States, it said.
   The announcement came three days after the department issued an
unusual public terrorism alert, warning of the possibility of an
attack on U.S. targets in Western Europe or west Africa.
   Concern for such an attack was based on recent reports of
movement of terrorists from the Middle East and the discovery of
weapons shipments destined for pro-Iranian groups in Spain and
Africa.
   It also reflected concern that terrorists might seek to use
violence to observe the anniversaries of the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103 or other attacks that have taken place during
the holiday season.
