   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Tuesday's auction to their highest level since
October.
   The Treasury Department sold $7.8 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.77 percent, up from 7.62 percent
last week. Another $7.8 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.64 percent, up from 7.43 percent last
week.
   The rates were the highest since three-month bills sold for 7.78
percent on Oct. 30, and six-month bills averaged 7.92 percent on
Oct. 2.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
_ 8.04 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,803.60 and 8.06 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,613.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.66
percent last week, down from 7.73 percent the previous week.
