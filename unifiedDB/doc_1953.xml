   A fire in an oil company warehouse triggered
a night-long series of explosions that shot fireballs as high as
150 feet in the air, officials said Tuesday.
   The fire at Troco Oil Co., which began Monday night, was under
control by early Tuesday afternoon, officials said. Troco officials
did not return telephone calls seeking comment, but Fire Department
spokesman Jim White said the company's owner had been notified of
the fire.
   A juvenile detention center and a shelter across from Troco were
evacuated without incident. The only injury reported was to a
firefighter whose eyes were irritated with foam. He was treated at
a hospital and released.
   Firefighters used water unsuccessfully on the fire for about 1{
hours until a Sun Co. foam truck arrived to help smother it, White
said. Sun Co. operates a nearby refinery.
   Troco ``blends oils for special applications. Everything in
there is oil or some type of lubricant,'' White said.
   ``We thought we had it with this foam, but we had trouble
getting to the seat of the fire,'' White said. ``About 1:30 or 2
a.m., we knew we were not doing any good. The oil was fueling the
fire and we started having explosion after explosion, with flames
150 feet in the air.''
   White said firefighters will spend the next couple of days
spraying hot spots at the plant, and it will be several days before
an inspection can be made to determine the cause of the fire.
