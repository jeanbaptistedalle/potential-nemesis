   Police set up a roadblock late
Sunday to prevent 1,000 activists, including Winnie Mandela, from
staging a candlelight vigil outside the prison where black leader
Nelson Mandela is held.
   Mrs. Mandela and the other demonstrators, traveling in 10 buses
and about 50 cars, were stopped by police about a half-mile outside
Victor Verster Prison near Cape Town, where her husband is confined
in a staff house.
   The demonstrators called for the immediate release of Mandela
and all others they consider political prisoners.
   Police gave Mrs. Mandela permission to visit her husband, but
she declined after learning that the other demonstrators would not
be allowed to hold their vigil at the prison's front gate.
   A magistrate turned down an application for the demonstration
because it was not submitted the required five days in advance.
   After reaching the roadblock, the activists sang freedom songs
beside the the road, then held a meeting in the nearby town of
Paarl.
   Mandela, the country's best known black leader, has been
imprisoned for more than 27 years. He is serving a life sentence
for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-led government.
   His release, however, is widely expected within weeks.
   Mandela, leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement, met President F.W. de Klerk at his office
Wednesday to discuss prospects for opening black-white political
negotiations.
