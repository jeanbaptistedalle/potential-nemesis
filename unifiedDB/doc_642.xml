   Martin Marietta will try for the
fifth time tonight to launch its first commercial Titan 3 rocket
with British and Japanese communications satellites.
   Stiff high-altitude winds forced a delay Tuesday night, just as
they had on Monday. Technical and weather problems caused two
postponements earlier in December.
   ``The upper level winds are too strong for Titan this evening,''
launch commentator Bob Gordon said Tuesday. The announcement came
after the countdown reached the five-minute mark and was being held
there for a weather evaluation.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:21 p.m. today.
