   The Pentagon says the Stealth fighter passed
its first combat test during the Panama military intervention by
hitting its targets in a raid on a field outside a Panamanian
military barracks.
   ``The mission was successful,'' spokesman Pete Williams said
Tuesday, telling reporters that the F-117 aircraft's sophisticated
bombs ``precisely hit their targets.''
   Asked whether the F-117's had any other role in the
intervention, the spokesman said, ``No, that was the sole mission.
Others were considered but they were discarded.''
   He declined to say what they were. Williams also declined to say
how many of the airplanes were involved or what kind of bombs they
dropped.
   The Washington Post on Saturday quoted unnamed government
officials as saying they understood the plane was tapped for the
job of bombing hideouts of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega before he
could get away.
   Williams repeated earlier Pentagon statements that the objective
of the Stealth plane was ``not to hit the barracks, but rather, in
fact, the mission was to miss the barracks and hit the field _ and
by nature of the explosion, disorient and stun and confuse and
frighten, frankly,'' the Panamanian soldiers.
   ``I'm told that the F-117 hit it very precisely and that it was
the precision of the F-117's bombing capability that was the reason
it was used,'' he said.
   ``I don't know how much of a factor the stealthiness was,'' he
said.
