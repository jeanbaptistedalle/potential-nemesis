   The Roman Catholic Church called on
the United States Saturday to end its military action promptly,
saying the attack had ``trampled'' on Panama's sovereignty and
caused death, destruction and hunger.
   ``Even though the action was aimed at bringing freedom to all
Panamanians, we cannot help but lament the deep wound inflicted to
our free and sovereign country and the enormous human and material
damages it has caused, especially among the poor,'' said a
communique from the nation's Roman Catholic bishops that was read
by Archbishop Marcos McGrath.
   The church asked that food and medicine be sent to the embattled
nation following a four-day looting spree that created shortages
after Wednesday's assault on Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces.
   The Panamanian people are ``living through an invasion and days
of ncertainty because of the U.S. military action that was
undertaken with the declared intention of toppling a dictatorial
regime and installing democracy,'' the statement said.
   Although the church has strongly opposed Noriega, the statement
did not mention the general by name. He was toppled by U.S. troops
and a new government installed, but remains at large.
   The church also asked the United States to ``end their military
action as soon as possible'' and that the newly installed civilian
government restore order and create a new police force to stop
rampant looting.
   ``It hurts us that Panamanian and foreign blood has been spilled
on our soil,'' it said. ``It hurts us because our nationality, our
Panamanian sovereignty has been trampled.''
