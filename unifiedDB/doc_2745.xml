   Hermann Julius Oberth, a pioneer
of the space age who worked with Wernher von Braun to help develop
Germany's V-2 rocket, died Friday after a short illness. He was 95.
   He began experiments on a conical jet motor for the German
government in 1930 and developed a model later that year. Oberth
worked on the motor with von Braun, who later became the leading
scientist in U.S. space flight development.
   He submitted a thesis on rocket experiments for his doctorate,
which was turned down as too cursory. An expanded version was
published in 1923 as the book, ``The Rockets to the Planets in
Space.''
   A third publication of the work in 1929, ``The Way to Spaceship
Travel,'' is today seen as a pioneering work in rocket research.
