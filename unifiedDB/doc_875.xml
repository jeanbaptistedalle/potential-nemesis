<HEAD>Sears, Government Settle Insulation Ads Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has agreed to pay a
$100,000 civil penalty to settle a dispute with the government over
insulation ads, the Federal Trade Commission said.
   The FTC said Tuesday that Sears or its representatives failed to
include details on the insulation's heat resistance when it
promoted the thickness and price of the product.
   The ads ran within the last five years.
   Chicago-based Sears has agreed to create an advertisement
designed to educate consumers about home insulation, especially the
importance of having heat-resistance information when making a
purchase, the FTC said.
   The settlement must be approved by a federal judge in
Washington. The FTC said the consent decree does not constitute
admission of a law violation. The penalty is paid to the
government, not consumers.
