   Maoist guerrillas killed eight store owners in
the main square of a small Andean town after giving them a mock
trial on charges of selling food at inflated prices, police said.
   In a separate incident, police said Wednesday that a group of
the Shining Path rebels attacked the town of Sacsamarca, 225 miles
southeast of Lima, and killed eight members of a peasant community
defense group.
   A police patrol encountered the guerrillas as they left the town
on Tuesday and killed two rebels, police said.
   Also Tuesday, 10 guerrillas armed with automatic weapons entered
the town of Changos Alto, 175 miles southeast of Lima, where they
sought out the owners of eight small businesses.
   After staging a ``people's trial'' in the town square, in which
they accused the eight of hoarding food to resell at inflated
prices, the rebels shot them to death, police said.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected government in 1980. The government says more than 17,000
people have died in the violence.
