<HEAD>Troubled Airline Agrees to Return Jetliners Leased From Irish Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. and the Irish aviation company
GPA Group PLC announced an agreement Thursday for the return to GPA
of five jetliners leased earlier this year to the Orlando-based
airline.
   The announcement came 10 days after GPA filed lawsuits against
the carrier in Orlando and in Kansas City, Mo., seeking the return
of five Airbus Industrie A320 planes. GPA had accused the airline
of failing to pay $3 million owed for the jets by a Nov. 27
deadline.
   ``We are returning the A320's as a show of good faith that we
wish to work together with GPA as we continue to reorganize our
finances under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,''
Braniff spokeswoman Ann Cook said in a statement.
   GPA's lawsuits against Braniff, Cook said, ``will be dismissed,
and GPA will also drop its claim for attorneys' fees and cost
claims'' over the lawsuits.
   In December 1988, GPA agreed to lease Braniff a total of 26 of
the 150-seat Airbus A320's. Under terms of that agreement, Braniff
also purchased 24 more of the aircraft from Airbus Industrie, a
European consortium.
   The airline also holds options to buy an additional 50 of the
jetliners.
   ``Braniff is actively attempting to market these rights to
maximize the value of the A320's,'' said Cook, who also said
Thursday's accord over the return to GPA of the five planes did not
affect the two companies' rights over the other 21 airliners.
   On Sept. 28, Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
and sharply reduced its scheduled passenger service. The airline
suspended all scheduled service Nov. 6 but remains a charter
carrier.
   Braniff also announced Thursday a net loss for the quarter ended
Oct. 31 of $134.9 million, compared with a loss of $7.8 million for
the same quarter in 1988.
