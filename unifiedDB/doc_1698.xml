   The temperature was only 40 and the
wind was blowing, but Sunday's record cold was accompanied by good
waves that attracted die-hard surfers.
   ``It's not often to find waves that big,'' said Paul
Meccariello, 27. ``It's something to do with the weather. Usually
the big waves are blocked by the Bahamas Islands.''
   More than 50 surfers clad in insulating wetsuits gathered in the
67-degree water waiting for good waves. Earlier in the day, Miami
had cooled to a record low of just 31 degrees.
   Meccariello couldn't estimate how high the waves were. There
were swells that appeared several feet high in a small area.
   He had called a recorded surf report from his home in Hollywood,
Fla.
   ``They said this was the spot to be. This is where they're
breaking,'' he said. ``I guess they all called there, too,'' he
said of the other surfers.
   In spite of the good surf, Ben Alloche, 17, was going home.
``It's too crowded,'' he said.
   It was too cold to work on a tan, so tourists with coats
buttoned and hands thrust into their pockets watched the surfers
from the beach.
   Marcus Lemmler, 23, arrived Thursday from Switzerland, which he
said has had record high temperatures.
   ``There's no snow in Switzerland, so we came to Miami to find
it,'' he laughed.
