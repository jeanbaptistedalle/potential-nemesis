   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange shot
higher Monday morning as the market responded to both real and
potential bid situations.
   ``The market has been pushed higher across the board,'' said one
dealer. ``Bid activity and rumors are once again kicking it
higher.''
   At 1215 GMT, the key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 index
was up 17.3 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,362.0 points, near its
high for the session of 2,363.9 points. The index was sharply
higher than an earlier intraday low of 2,343.1 points.
   At 1200 GMT, the narrower Financial Times-30 share index was up
13.1 points at 1,864.8 points. Trading volume amounted to a
moderate 249.3 million shares.
   The market moved strongly ahead after Lyonnaise des Eaux, a
French public utilities group, said that it has built a stake of 9
percent in Anglian water. The French company also said that it has
bought 6 percent of Wessex Water PLC, and 2 percent of Severn Trent
PLC. In response to the news, the newly privatized 10 water
authorities of England and Wales rose sharply.
   Earlier Monday, Fisons PLC, a pharmaceutical, horticultural and
scientific equipment maker, announced a friendly 270.2 million
pound bid for V.G. Instruments PLC, a British scientific equipment
maker in which BAT Industries PLC has a 69-percent stake.
   Also, Fletcher Callenge Ltd. of New Zealand Monday said it is
making a friendly 299 million-pound takeover offer for British
Paper PLC, upstaging a 263 million-pound bid by Finland's
Metsa-Serla Oy.
