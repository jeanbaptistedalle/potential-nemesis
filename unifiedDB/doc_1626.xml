   The FBI and state and local police
arrested six men Saturday who had broken into a bank and are
potential suspects in bank burglaries in the United States and
Canada, an FBI spokesman said.
   The men had already outsmarted the bank's alarm system when they
were arrested about 4 a.m. while trying to break into the vault of
the Coolidge Bank and Trust Co., said spokesman Paul Cavanaugh.
   The arrests culminated a 14- to 16-month joint investigation and
surveillance involving the FBI and Montreal police, Cavanaugh said.
   The men had broken in by drilling a hole through a concrete
floor from offices above the bank. They were carrying a cache of
burglary tools, electronic scanners and walkie-talkies, FBI
officials said.
   Arrested were James Joseph McCormack, 50, and John Joseph
Murray, 35, both of Charlestown; Benjamin Wonsch, 49, of Plymouth;
and Paul T. Bryntwick, 38, Ronald McCann, 57, and Talbot Murphy,
61, all of Montreal.
   The men were being held in area jails, and were scheduled to be
arraigned Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Boston.
   The six are possible suspects in a half-dozen unsolved bank
burglaries in the United States and Canada, Cavanaugh said.
Saturday's heist was similar to a successful 1988 holiday weekend
burglary of a Boston bank that reportedly netted $125,000.
