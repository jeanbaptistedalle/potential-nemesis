   Israeli paratroopers
ordered holiday shoppers home Saturday after a clash with Arab
stonethrowers. South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu declared his
support for a Palestinian state.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, troops opened fire on masked
stonethrowers, killing two and wounding 12, Arab reporters said.
   The army confirmed that one Arab youth was killed and said the
military was investigating the reports of a second death.
   The deaths raised the number of Palestinians killed in the
two-year uprising against Israeli occupation to 639. Forty Israelis
also have died in the violence and Palestinians have killed at
least 161 Arabs on suspicion of cooperating with Israeli
authorities.
   Arab reporters identified the dead youths as Mohammed Zakaria
el-Hourani, 22, and Aymad Mohammed al-Atrash, 17. Hospital
officials reported that 21 Palestinians were wounded in scattered
clashes with troops throughout Gaza.
   In Bethlehem, masked youths burned tires and hurled stones at
army patrols near the Church of the Nativity. The site marks the
manger where tradition holds that Jesus was born.
   Troops shot bursts of fire from their automatic weapons into the
air to disperse the youths and fired tear gas into alleyways of the
nearby marketplace where they fled.
   Red-bereted paratroopers and purple-bereted troops from the
elite Givati brigade ran through the marketplace shouting ``ruhi
el-beit,'' Arabic for ``go home,'' at holiday shoppers.
   One enraged shopper turned to a soldier and said: ``You can't
close the shops, this is our holiday,'' but the soldier ordered her
home.
   The troops also confiscated identity cards from Palestinians and
refused to return them until the Arabs removed barricades from the
streets and swept up debris from burning tires.
   Slogans were spray-painted on walls throughout the town urging
renewed clashes with troops Christmas Day.
   In Jerusalem, Tutu joined Moslem leaders and activists and bowed
his head in silent prayer at a memorial to the almost 600
Palestinians slain in 1982 by Israeli-backed Christian militiamen
in Lebanon's Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps.
   ``We support the struggle of the Palestinian people in their
longing for statehood and independence,'' Tutu told nearly 30
Palestinian dignitaries. ``We are struggling for our own
self-determination in South Africa.''
   ``We pray that the day will come soon when a Palestinian state
will exist side-by-side with a Jewish state and Arab and Jew will
hold hands together,'' said Tutu, who arrived Friday for a five-day
visit.
