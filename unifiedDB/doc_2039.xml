   Flooding in Brazil's normally dry
east-central region has killed 24 people and left at least 140,000
homeless, national civil defense spokesman Silvio Reiner says.
   Speaking by telephone on Tuesday from Brasilia, the capital, 750
miles northwest of Rio, Reiner said 140 cities and towns in five of
the 26 states were affected by flooding, caused by more than two
weeks of torrential rain.
   Unofficial reports said most of those killed drowned or were
buried when houses collapsed.
   Reiner said the worst hit area was northeastern Bahia state,
where 105,000 people were driven from their homes.
   Road traffic between Cachoeira, 930 miles northeast of Rio, and
the rest of the country was cut off by the Paraguacu River, which
overflowed and covered much of the city.
   TV film showed canoes and rowboats paddling down flooded streets
with families carrying sofas, stoves and other household goods to
dry ground.
   The city dates from the Portuguese colonial era and is
considered a national historic monument.
   Cachoeira was without electricity and was running out of food
and drinking water, Reiner said. Civil defense workers were flying
in emergency shipments of food, blankets and medicine, mainly
antityphoid and snakebite serum, he said.
   In Minas Gerais state, south of Bahia, 5,765 houses collapsed in
70 townships, the official said, and 24,200 people were homeless.
   About 11,000 Brazilians had to abandon their homes in nearby
Goias, Tocantins and Maranhao states, he said.
   More rain for the region was forecast.
