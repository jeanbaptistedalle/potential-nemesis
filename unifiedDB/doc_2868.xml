   Talk and game show host Pat Sajak married
former Playboy model Lesly Brown in a private ceremony Sunday.
   Sajak, 42, married Brown, 24, in a 40-minute ceremony at St.
Mary's Roman Catholic Church as about 10 police officers stood
guard outside.
   Information about the ceremony was sketchy because the couple
sold exclusive rights to the nuptials to People magazine.
   Brown is a University of Maryland graduate and former ``Miss
Georgetown'' who appeared in Playboy magazine's 1988 ``Women of
Washington'' feature.
   She met the host of ``The Pat Sajak Show'' and ``Wheel of
Fortune'' at the celebrity opening of a restaurant in Irvine,
Calif., in 1988.
   Few celebrities were counted among the 100-150 guests, but
Sajak's wheel turner and close friend, Vanna White, was spotted
dodging from the church.
