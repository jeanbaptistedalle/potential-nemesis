<HEAD>Studio Changes Name of Robert Taylor Building After Complaints</HEAD>

   The Lorimar Studios changed the name
of its Robert Taylor Building after tenants complained in a
petition that the late actor testified before Congress against
Hollywood figures.
   The petitioners wanted Taylor's name banished because he
testified before the old House Un-American Activities Committee
against the so-called Hollywood 10, writers alleged to have
associated with communist organizations during the 1930s, '40s or
'50s.
   Taylor also was considered a supporter of the Hollywood
blacklist that kept those writers from working under their own
names.
   Arnold Shupack, senior vice president and general manager of
Lorimar, approved the name change on Nov. 15, his office said
Wednesday.
   Shupack changed the name of the building, containing mostly
offices of people connected to the industry, to the George Cukor
Building. Cukor directed most of his films on the movie lot that
Lorimar took over from MGM.
   Before MGM sold the lot, the 74-year-old building was called the
Lion Building. Lorimar changed the names of the lot's old buildings
to honor former movie stars.
   Taylor died of lung cancer in June 1969.
