   A 600-foot Greek freighter loaded with scrap
metal sank in the Pacific early Sunday after its 28 crewmen gave up
a two-day fight to pump seawater out of its hold and abandoned
ship, the Coast Guard said.
   The Vulka went down 800 miles northeast of Hawaii.
   The crewmen were evacuated to the Coast Guard buoy tender
Sassafras on Saturday when malfunctioning pumps failed to keep
ahead of the flooding that made the bow dip below the waterline,
officials said.
   The cause of the flooding was not determined before the ship
went down, officials said.
   There was no immediate estimate of the value of the ship and its
cargo.
   Crewmen had used pumps dropped from Coast Guard planes in an
effort to keep the ship afloat until a commercial salvage ship from
Honolulu could reach the scene Monday, said Coast Guard Chief Petty
Officer Dennis Hubbard.
   The Sassafras also unsuccessfully tried to tow the Vulka around,
away from the wind, to keep waves from washing over the bow,
Hubbard said.
   The Vulka was carrying cargo from Los Angeles to South Korea
when it radioed a distress call Friday.
