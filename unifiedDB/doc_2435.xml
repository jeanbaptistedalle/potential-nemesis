<HEAD>Soybean Futures Climb on Rumored East Europe Meal Buying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, leading the grain markets higher amid
widespread rumors of new buying interest from Eastern Europe.
   The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary
all were said to be in the market for soybean meal.
   Algeria was rumored to have bought some U.S. soybean meal
overnight.
   The rally halted a downward trend in the soybean market, which
had been drifting lower for more than a week.
   A pickup in soybean meal sales in Europe also supported the
market, analysts said.
   The strength in the soybean complex spilled over to the corn and
wheat markets, which had opened nearly unchanged due to a lack of
significant new export business.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.08\ a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $2.40 a bushel; oats were 1\
cents to 2 cents higher with March at $1.54 a bushel; soybeans were
4\ cents to 7{ cents higher with January at $5.70 a bushel.
