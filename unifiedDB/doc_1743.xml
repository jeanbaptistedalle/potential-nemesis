<HEAD>Communist Leadership Meets on Lithuanian Party's Breakaway Move</HEAD>

   The Soviet Communist Party leadership met today to
deal with the Lithuanian party's unprecedented declaration of
independence from the Kremlin.
   Lithuanian Communists voted Wednesday at a special congress in
Vilnius to form their own party, rejecting appeals for unity from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other top Soviet officials.
   State-run Radio Moscow reported that the national party's
policy-making Central Committee convened in Moscow ``to consider
the situation in the Lithuanian party branch.''
   The Lithuanians' break is serious because it is without
precedent in the history of the party founded by Vladimir I. Lenin,
who demanded and forged a unitary party across the entire territory
of the Soviet Union. Lithuanian reformers predict local party
organizations in many of the other 14 constituent Soviet republics
may follow suit.
   Algirdas Brazauskas, the Lithuanian party leader, said the
break, which included drafting a separate party program, was
necessary for Lithuanian Communists to compete successfully in
local elections Feb. 24.
   However, Lithuanian Communists who opposed the break formed
their own leadership, and pledged continuing loyalty to Moscow.
   The national party leadership invited both Brazauskas and the
leaders of the anti-separatist faction to Moscow to attend today's
meeting, Radio Moscow said.
