   Two hot-air balloons bearing peace slogans
were anchored Wednesday in front of the Brandenburg Gate as a sign
of friendship.
   Dozens of people looked on as a joint French-West German team
began anchoring the mammoth, brightly colored balloons.
   The team had expected officials would turn down their request to
anchor the balloons on East Berlin territory, but the Foreign
Ministry granted permission, the official ADN news agency said.
   ``We have the luck to experience this new epoch of peace and
understanding,'' said Jean-Marc Culas, the head of the team. ``We
simply wanted to be there and bring our message with the balloons
to everyone.''
   It was yet another sign of relaxed rules along the once-dreaded
Berlin Wall, where dozens of souvenir-seekers continue hack away on
the western side gathering souvenirs.
   West Berlin police said they had taken into custody two
Americans and a West Berlin man who had broken out seven sections
of the wall, each measuring 8 feet high by more than 3 feet wide.
   The unidentified men apparently wanted to sell the sections as
souvenirs and had loaded five of them onto a truck before they were
caught, police said. Police said they were cited for theft and
released.
