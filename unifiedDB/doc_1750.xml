   Santa wore a red stocking cap and a police
badge as he handed out free gifts to the needy, but residents of an
alleged crack house invited him inside anyway.
   As a result, four of the house's residents were spending
Christmas weekend in jail, police said.
   Officer Conrad De Castro had been assigned to get a description
of the house so police could seek a warrant to search it for drugs.
   He approached the house on Saturday in uniform, wearing the
stocking cap and carrying presents. The occupants asked for some of
his gifts, and he told them he would return with others.
   He did, with a few empty boxes all wrapped up, and other
officers waiting outside.
   As the alleged drug dealers unwrapped the boxes, police said De
Castro noticed one gift under their Christmas tree: a plastic bag
that appeared to contain crack cocaine.
   De Castro used his walkie-talkie to alert other officers, who
helped make the arrests, police said.
