   A man stole a car and then abandoned two toddlers
that had been left in it, leading police to search with cars and a
helicopter, authorities said.
   The boys, ages 2 and 4, were found about two hours later,
frightened but OK. Temperatures were below freezing when they were
dropped off in a large city park Saturday.
   ``That's the most low-down car thief I've ever heard of,'' said
Detective Roberto Garza. ``Those two little children could have
frozen to death in that dark park, but he just drove away and left
them there.''
   The boys' mother, Araceli Delgadillo, told police she had parked
at a grocery store and had left the engine running. She said she
had told the boys to lock the door behind her. When she returned
after 20 minutes, the car and her sons were gone.
   Police used patrol cars and a helicopter to search for the
missing children. A volunteer found the boys shivering in the park
about 6 p.m.
   No one has been arrested.
