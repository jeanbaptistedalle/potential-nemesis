<HEAD>Independent Review Says Virginia Guard Acted Professionally</HEAD>

   The Virginia Army National Guard performed
``in a highly professional manner'' during Labor Day disturbances
in Virginia Beach, according to findings of an independent review
announced Tuesday by the National Guard Bureau.
   Lt. Gen. Herbert R. Temple Jr., chief of the bureau, said the
review was conducted by a team led by Brig. Gen. John H. McDonald
of Delaware Army National Guard at the request of Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Sen.
John Warner, R-Va.
   He said the reviewers found no evidence to support contentions
that delays in deployment of the Guard on the morning of Sept. 3
contributed to the damage from looting and vandalism.
   The study showed that alert and call-up procedures ``worked
remarkably well considering the number of troops mobilized and
deployed, the short time period that elapsed between initial alert
and actual deployment, and the fact that it took place in the
middle of America's busiest summer holiday weekend.''
   Temple said no instance of physical abuse by a National Guard
member had been verified during the disturbances Sept. 1-5. He said
several members of the Guard received minor injuries, but none
required hospitalization.
