   _The head of the U.S. Southern Command discussed Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's fate with the Vatican ambassador. The United
States wants Noriega returned to the United States to stand trial
on drug charges.
   _Sources in Rome said the Vatican would rather hand Noriega over
to another country. But one country mentioned, Spain, has denied
him political asylum.
   _Many stores that had been looted bare reopened. Panamanians
returned to work.
   _U.S. military sources said they quelled scattered fighting from
Noriega loyalists and made arrests.
   _The Bush administration said it will seek to freeze assets
Noriega allegedly transferred out of Panama. Noriega hid more than
$10 million in drug money in a half-dozen countries, the Justice
Department said.
   _The U.S. military and the Panamanian government are arguing
over reconstituting the army _ the civilians want a weakened army,
U.S. officials a strong one.
   _Tons of medical supplies have arrived.

smuggle cocaine was jailed in Florida after surrendering in Panama.
Lt. Col. Luis del Cid pleaded not guilty.

wounded. The Panamanian Defense Forces were reported to have
suffered 293 dead, 123 wounded and 4,446 detained, and more than
100 Panamanian civilians were reported killed.
