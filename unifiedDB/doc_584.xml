   The stock market suffered another broad setback
today amid persistent worries about the future course of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 56.10 points in
the past two sessions, dropped 22.19 to 2,675.34 by 11 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 322 up, 949
down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.50 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said the latest economic reports from the government
hadn't done much to pull the market out of its recent slide,
induced to a great extent by worries about the real estate market
and mortgage debt.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.4 percent in November, or at an annual rate of 4.9 percent. That
appeared to put a new obstacle before any fresh moves by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Separate government figures showed a 4.7 percent decline in
housing starts last month.
   Brokers said that left stocks in the grip of recession fears and
of talk that a slump in business conditions might be exacerbated by
a weak market for homes and other real-estate properties.
   A few recently depressed mortgage and regional banking stocks
staged a rebound. Federal National Mortgage rose ] to 31{, and Bank
of New England gained ] to 7~.
   But most other bank stocks remained on the defensive. Citicorp
fell } to 26[; Chase Manhattan | to 31\; J.P. Morgan | to 40, and
Chemical Banking ] to 28~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.62 to 188.55. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.00 at 368.86.
