<HEAD>20,000 Strike for Higher Wages</HEAD>

   About 20,000 workers in a mining and
industrial complex walked off their jobs Friday, demanding a 40
percent pay increase, Belgrade Radio reported.
   If the strike continues at the Kolubara complex 35 miles south
of Belgrade, the operation of two plants essential for supplying
power to the Yugoslav capital would be threatened, the state news
agency Tanjug said.
   It was among several strikes throughout the country this month,
with workers protesting low wages amid a 2,500 percent annual
inflation rate and claiming they would be unable to cope with the
government austerity measures set to take effect Monday.
   About 200 coal miners in Ivangrad also went on strike for higher
wages and to protest the wage and price freeze announced by Premier
Ante Markovic's government.
   The government is embarking on a market-oriented economic reform
plan in which it has promised to shut down unprofitable enterprises.
   Other strikes involving several thousand workers were reported
earlier this week in cities of Mostar and Kragujevac.
   In Belgrade, several thousand strikers in engineering plants
obtained 50 percent raises Thursday.
