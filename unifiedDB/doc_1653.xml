   Queen Margrethe II of Denmark has
decided to return orders she received from toppled Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu, press reports said Sunday.
   Queen Margrethe and the Prince Consort Henrik were decorated
with Romanian orders during Ceausescu's official visit to Denmark
in November 1980, the daily Jyllands-Posten said.
   The queen also canceled the Order of the Knight of the Great
Cross, which she gave to Ceausescu's wife, Elena.
   The former president was erased as Knight of the Elephant Order,
Denmark's most prestigious and highest ranking order, which is
awarded only to members of royal families and heads of state.
   Ceausescu was overthrown Friday in a popular revolt against his
hard-line Communist rule.
