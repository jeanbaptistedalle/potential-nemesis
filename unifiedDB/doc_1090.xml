   Czechoslovkia's new government has
taken the first steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations with
Israel after a 22-year break, a deputy premier said Thursday.
   Valtr Komarek told reporters the Cabinet had ``discussed the
preparations for negotiations over diplomatic relations with South
Korea and Israel.''
   Czechoslovakia and most other Soviet bloc nations, with the
exception of Romania, broke diplomatic ties with Israel in 1967
during the Middle East war.
   Israel and Czechoslovakia under its former hard-line Communist
leaders discussed the possiblity of restoring ties last year, but
the talks failed to produce results.
   Komarek said the new government planned to resume negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier ``is to prepare concrete
measures and proposals for the negotiations,'' Komarek said.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist dominated government, swept
into power by a peaceful pro-democracy revolution, was sworn in
Dec. 10.
