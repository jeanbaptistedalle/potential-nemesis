   Japanese firms spent a record 4.55 trillion yen, or
$32 billion, on entertainment and gifts in 1988, more than the
government plans to spend on defense next year, the National Tax
Administration Agency said Wednesday.
   Total expense account spending rose by 8.7 percent from the
previous high of 4.19 trillion yen, or $29 billion, in 1987, said
an agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said the agency estimated total expense account spending
based on a survey of 57,599 of Japan's 1,851,653 companies that
closed their annual accounts in January 1989.
   The survey showed average expense account spending of 3 cents
for every $7 in company income, the official said.
   Japanese executives often are given carte blanche to entertain
at exclusive night clubs and Japanese-style inns. Inviting clients
for golf and presenting gifts are other customary entertainment
expenses.
   The government's draft budget for the fiscal year beginning in
April 1990 allocates 4.14 trillion yen, or $29.1 billion, for
defense spending, up 5.5 percent from fiscal 1989.
