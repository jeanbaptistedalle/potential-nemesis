   A judge has dismissed charges against
a 75-year-old anti-tax crusader accused of plotting earlier this
year to kill then-Mayor Henry Cisneros, ruling the defendant had
been entrapped.
   Parker Abell, 75, had been charged with solicitation of capital
murder, accused of offering a district attorney's investigator
$5,000 in May for Cisneros' slaying. Cisneros did not seek
re-election and left office in June.
   Defense attorney Steve Hilbig argued that it was investigator
John Veltkamp, not Abell, who was doing the persuading during their
videotaped meeting in May, and District Judge Mike Machado agreed
Monday that Abell was entrapped.
   ``It's an early Christmas present for Mr. Abell,'' said Hilbig,
a former assistant U.S. attorney seeking the Republican nomination
for district attorney.
   ``That's what they should have done,'' Abell told his lawyer and
the judge.
   Assistant District Attorney Julian Lopez said the law on
entrapment is broad and that there was room for other
interpretations, but he doubted prosecutors would pursue the case
against the cancer-stricken Abell, a retired railroad employee from
Natalia.
   ``I imagine that would be a factor in whether we appeal,'' Lopez
said. ``He's old. He's very sick.''
   Abell, who officials said had not paid taxes for 10 years, is a
one-time Libertarian candidate for Congress.
   Hilbig said he believes the investigation of Abell was initiated
by the Internal Revenue Service in 1988 after Abell called into a
radio talk show to complain about rising taxes.
   According to testimony, the IRS paid an informant $1,000 in
advance to develop information on Abell.
