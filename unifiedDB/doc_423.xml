   Gov. Rose Mofford was reported in stable
condition this morning after surgery to remove her gallbladder.
   Her surgeon said there is an ``excellent chance'' the
67-year-old Democrat will be back on her feet in time to give her
State of the State address Jan. 8.
   St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center said in a statement
that she slept well overnight.
   Mrs. Mofford was hospitalized Sunday with chest pain. Tests
showed no heart trouble and discovered instead that she had a
gallbladder attack and had gallstones and an irritated pancreas.
The hour-long operation took place Monday.
   Dr. Victor Zannis, who performed the operation, said Mrs.
Mofford's pancreas is likely to heal itself. He predicted she would
be out of the hospital in five to 10 days ``if everything goes
well.''
