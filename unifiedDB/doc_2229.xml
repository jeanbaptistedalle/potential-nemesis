   Blue Arrow PLC, the world's largest employment
services group, said Wednesday that Southeastern Asset Management
of the United States had boosted its stake to 8.4 percent from 7.16
percent.
   Blue Arrow said it has been informed that Southeastern now holds
6 million American Depositary Shares, which represents 60.2 million
of Blue Arrow's outstanding shares.
   Southeastern Asset Management acquired its initial stake in
September.
   At the time, Blue Arrow chairman Mitchell Fromstein said the
company welcomed its shareholding, and said it was a friendly
investment. Fromstein also said that he wouldn't have been bothered
if the American company had taken a bigger stake.
