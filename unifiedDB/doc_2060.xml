   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
record high for the second consecutive day today, while the dollar
declined against the Japanese yen for the fifth trading day in a
row.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31
percent, closing at 38,801.63.
   Dealers said investors, encouraged by the yen's firmness against
the dollar, were buying on a broad front.
   Surging prices for futures contracts also led to strong
expectations of share price gains, they added.
   Volume traded on the exchange's first section was estimated at
900 million shares, up from 650 million shares Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's
finish of 142.37 yen. After opening at 142.13 yen, it ranged
between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 2.13 yen in five days.
   Currency dealers described trading as thin with the approaching
year-end holiday season.
   The market is expecting lower U.S. interest rates, dealers said,
while the yen is gaining some support from the Bank of Japan's
decision Monday to increase its official discount rate to 4.25
percent from 3.75 percent to stem inflationary pressure. Higher
interest rates usually make a country's currency more attractive to
investors.
   The U.S. official discount rate, the rate charged for central
bank loans to commercial banks, currently stands at 7 percent.
