   A young girl was shot to death at a mall
jammed with holiday shoppers, and police arrested a 12-year-old boy
following a three-hour search.
   Jacalyn Calabrese, 12, of Orange, who was shot once in the head
at the Mall of Orange, apparently knew the boy, said police Sgt.
Art Ramo.
   The suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, was
being questioned late Monday, Romo said. No motive was given.
   The boy was arrested outside a home about three blocks from the
mall after a search by helicopters, police dogs and officers,
authorities said.
   A guard at the Sears department store that anchors one end of
the mall said guards from the store chased the boy after Monday
evening's shooting, but he escaped.
   The mall was jammed with holiday shoppers when the shooting
occurred, said Maria Jacobs, the Sears' manager.
