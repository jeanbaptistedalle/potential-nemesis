   Accidents on the nation's roads and highways
claimed 353 lives during the four-day Christmas weekend, but the
death toll was lower than last year's.
   California had the highest number of fatalities with 48,
followed by Texas with 28 and Florida with 27.
   The death toll was well within estimates made by the
Chicago-based National Safety Council, which had predicted that
from 320 to 420 people would die in traffic accidents during the
holiday weekend.
   The official counting period began at 6 p.m. local time Friday
and ended at 11:59 p.m. local time Monday.
   The council said its estimates were based on data from previous
years, seasonal weather factors and national driving safety trends.
During last year's Christmas holiday, 386 traffic fatalities were
reported.
   For the New Year's holiday period, the council estimates that
between 250 and 350 people could die in road accidents, compared
with 317 last year. The New Year's counting period begins at 6 p.m.
local time Friday and runs through 11:59 p.m. local time Monday.
