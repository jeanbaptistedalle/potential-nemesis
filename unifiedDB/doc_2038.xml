   For what seemed like an eternity, we screamed that we were
journalists.
   The men who came out of a bunker to us _ some in uniform, some
in civilian clothes _ screamed at us and dragged us to them.
   We were roughed up. One man came at me with a knife but stopped
just before stabbing me. A soldier kept a gun aimed at my head. I
thought they were going to kill us.
   My companion, Ljuba, was not hit by the gunfire, but he was
beaten. They took our money.
   Of the Italians, one was badly wounded in the chest, and the
other unhurt.
   Finally, to my relief, two ambulances arrived. The Italian
photographer, Pasquale Modita, went first. Then me.
   The ride to the hospital was mercifully brief, and for my second
night in Romania, I was once again under the physicians' protection.
   The bullets had gone into my upper left arm, a few inches from
my heart. The other one cut a gash in my scalp, but did not
penetrate my skull.
   ``You were very, very lucky,'' my favorite doctor told me. Time
and again, the doctor said after my first operation to explore the
wound in my arm, ``Someone as lucky as you will live a long time.''
   For the two nights and a day that I convalesced in the hospital,
battle raged outside my window between the Romanian army and small,
ruthless commando units loyal to Ceasescu.
   I worried that the Securitate would win and murder us all.
   But Christmas Day, about 36 hours after being shot, ambulances
arranged by the Yugoslav government and The AP took me and Zzeljko
Ssajan, a wounded reporter from Zagreb television, to Belgrade.
   I was never so happy to cross a border.
