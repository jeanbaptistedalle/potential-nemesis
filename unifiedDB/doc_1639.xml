   Associated Press Correspondent John
Daniszewski was shot and wounded by a group of uniformed men who
stopped his car and was in satisfactory condition in a Timisoara
hospital Sunday, the Yugoslav Consulate said.
   The consulate, in a telephone call to the AP's Belgrade bureau,
said Daniszewski's wounds were not life-threatening. One bullet
entered his arm above the elbow before exiting at his shoulder, and
two more grazed his head, said the consulate, adding that he was at
Judecian hospital in Timisoara.
   Daniszewski, a correspondent based in Warsaw, Poland, was in the
Romanian city about 30 miles east of the Yugoslav border to cover
the revolution in Romania.
   The consulate said it was informed about the shooting and
Daniszewski's condition by Ljuba Pajic, a Yugoslav journalist
working for the Politika Expres newspaper, who was with him in the
car.
   The two were ordered stopped Saturday night by a group of men in
uniform _ either soldiers or men belonging to deposed President
Nicolae Ceauescu's special police, which is resisting
revolutionaries backed by the army.
   As Daniszewski was braking, the group fired at the car, said
Pajic, who was unhurt. They subsequently robbed the two of their
belongings.
   Daniszewski was driven to hospital by a carload of Yugoslav
journalists.
