   Miss Bulgaria was deported from Britain on
Wednesday, 10 months after she arrived to begin a recording career,
the Home Office said.
   Sonia Vassilva, 20, left London's Heathrow airport on a
Bulgarian Airlines flight to the capital Sofia.
   Ms. Vassilva had said she feared for her safety if she was
returned to Bulgaria but appeals to the Home Office were
unsuccessful and she was deported on the grounds she entered the
country with an illegal passport.
   ``We've written to all the embassies to try to get her to be
taken in various countries,'' said Ms. Vassilva's London
representative, Max Clifford. ``But of course if you come into one
country with an illegal passport it blots your copy book.''
