   The stock market chalked up a small gain today,
pulling out of a weeklong slide.
   Trading was moderate.
   Analysts said evidence of a new move Wednesday toward easier
credit by the Federal Reserve encouraged buyers to nibble warily at
stocks that have lately suffered from worries about a possible
recession in 1990.
   Brokers also said traders remained hopeful that stock prices
might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One explanation often offered for the January effect is the
lifting of yearend selling pressures from investing institutions
cleaning losers out of their portfolios and individual investors
realizing losses for tax purposes.
