   The papal envoy in Panama who has had Manuel
Antonio Noriega as a house guest since Sunday was out of the
country when the U.S. invasion occurred and was flown back to
Panama aboard a special U.S. military flight, American officials
said Friday.
   Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, who has been a key figure in
the talks over Noriega's fate, was in Spain at the time of the
invasion and set out for Panama shortly thereafter.
   U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified, said Laboa was
unable to get back to Panama because flights were canceled during
the first few days after the invasion.
   The officials said Laboa felt it was important for him to be in
Panama during the critical post-invasion period because of the
influence he wields as Pope John Paul II's emissary.
   According to the officials, the U.S. military resolved Laboa's
problem by arranging a flight to Panama for him. Noriega turned up
at the envoy's residence four days after the invasion.
