   The 28-member crew of a Greek freighter
foundering 800 miles northeast of Hawaii fled to the safety of a
Coast Guard vessel Saturday, authorities said.
   The Vulca, with a load of scrap metal bound for South Korea from
Los Angeles, was in danger of sinking with water flooding into its
forward holds. The cause of the flooding has not been determined.
   A Coast Guard plane dropped five water pumps to the 600-foot
freighter on Friday after the ship radioed a distress call, but
none of the pumps were working by Saturday evening because seawater
continued flowing into the holds, Chief Petty Officer Dennis
Hubbard said.
   If the water was contained to just the two forward holds, the
Vulca had a chance of remaining afloat until a commercial salvage
ship arrived Monday to tow it to Honolulu, Hubbard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Sassafras, which arrived on scene earlier
Saturday, tried to tow the Vulca out of the wind which was blowing
the water over the bow, but the effort failed, Hubbard said.
   The Sassafras, which replaced a commercial tanker that had come
to the Vulca's aid, was to stand by the abandoned freighter until
it sank or the salvage ship arrived, he said.
   The Coast Guard previously had erroneously identified the ship
as the Bulka.
