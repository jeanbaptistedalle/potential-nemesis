<HEAD>Film Critic Says Romance Is Gone From Today's Films</HEAD>

   Film critic Rex Reed says he loves movies, but
thinks so much of what is produced today is horrible.
   ``Ninety percent of the films today are toxic waste,'' he said.
``On every screen, you're confronted by the same girls you saw the
night before, buying yogurt and Kleenex at the Safeway.''
   Reed, who was born in Fort Worth, said romance has been replaced
with ``blood-splattering violence and a lot of crude sexual
calisthenics.''
   He also said movie-goers must get the idea that women today are
``whores, emotional cripples or birdbrains.''
   Reed said it isn't really a chore to review movies even though
he doesn't think highly of many of them.
   ``When they're bad, you don't remember them at all, but at least
you had fun for a couple hours,'' he said. ``So I do like movies,
and every time there's a good one, it revives my faith in the movie
business all over again.''
