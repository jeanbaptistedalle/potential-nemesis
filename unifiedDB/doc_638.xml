<HEAD>Spy Plane's 25th Anniversary Being Marked in Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A spy plane that was one of the
mainstays of Cold War intelligence-gathering today was marking its
25th anniversary with a flight over its maker's once-secret plants.
   The SR-71 Blackbird was to take off from Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale and fly over Lockheed Corp.'s plants in Burbank and Rye
Canyon.
   An SR-71 first flew on Dec. 22, 1964. Since then, Blackbirds,
which can fly at least three times the speed of sound and higher
than 85,000 feet, have helped U.S. intelligence keep watch on
sensitive areas around the globe.
   President Bush last week signed a defense appropriation bill
that did not include funding for the SR-71. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney and other top Pentagon officials had advocated
dropping the program.
   The Blackbird _ angular, with short wings and enormous engines _
replaced the U-2, a high-flying but slow craft.
