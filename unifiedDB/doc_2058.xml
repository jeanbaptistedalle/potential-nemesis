   A commuter plane crashed at the airport late
Tuesday, killing all five people aboard, authorities said.
   The United Express Jetstream apparently skidded off a runway
while trying to take off from Tri-Cities Airport, about 180 miles
southeast of Seattle, said Robert Mills, airport manager.
   Denise Monk, a Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher, said five
people were killed.
   ``As far as I know, it was everyone on the plane,'' firefighter
Forrest Stewart said of the victims. He said there were no injuries
reported.
   United Express is a Pasco-based commuter airline serving
Washington, Oregon and Idaho.
   No other details were immediately available.
