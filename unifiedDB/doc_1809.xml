<HEAD>BINGHAMTON: ... Martin's death.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Martin's pickup skidded 300 feet down an embankment and stopped
at the foot of his driveway, Port Crane Fire Chief John Eldrid said.
   Martin was 61.
   A second baseman on five Yankees World Series championship teams
during the 1950s, Martin was first hired to manage the team in
1975. His latest firing was on June 23, 1988, when he was replaced
by Lou Piniella, the man he replaced at the end of the 1987 season.
   He had 1,258 victories and 1,018 losses in 16 seasons as a major
league manager. In addition to the Yankees, he managed the
Minnesota, Detroit, Texas and Oakland teams. He led the Minnesota
Twins to an American League West title in 1969 and the Detroit
Tigers to an AL East title in 1970. He led the Yankees to AL
pennants in 1976 and 1977.
