   The stock market gained ground today, aided what
analysts described as yearend ``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.69 to 2,695.82 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 562 up, 380 down and
526 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.55 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Traders appeared to be shopping warily among recently depressed
stocks, hoping that the market will gather strength after the
pressure of tax selling is lifted with the arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Caterpillar dropped 2 to 55| on top of a 1~-point loss Thursday,
when the company reduced its earnings projection for the fourth
quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.28 to 190.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .17 at 369.38.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.20 to
2,691.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 926 up, 619 down and 463 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 175.15 million shares, against 176.52
million in the previous session.
