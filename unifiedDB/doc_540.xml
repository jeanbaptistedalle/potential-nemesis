   Guerrillas overran a remote town, stole
$697,000 from a bank truck and battled an army patrol in separate
attacks Tuesday in rural areas, authorities said. Six people were
reported killed and three injured.
   The first attack took place in Surata, a northeastern town 280
miles from Bogota, police said. The town remained under the control
of 50 guerrillas of the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army for
several hours, according to the Santander state police.
   The guerrilla group concentrated the attack on the police
headquarters, where it killed two policemen and seized weapons and
ammunition, the report said.
   The National Liberation Army is one of the most active of more
than 10 guerrilla groups operating in the Colombian jungle.
   In the southern area of Putumayo near the border with Ecuador,
guerrillas of the Maoist Popular Liberation Army attacked a bank
truck carrying $697,000, authorities said.
   The guerrillas killed two guards, injured three others, and
seized two more before stealing the money and fleeing into the
jungle, a police report released in Bogota said.
   Earlier, an army patrol in the Santander state was ambushed by
guerrillas of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, said Col.
Rodolfo Herrera, commander of the Colombian Army 14th Brigade. He
told reporters that the patrol repulsed the attack and killed two
rebels.
   The patrol was searching for an armed group that killed five
emerald traders Monday and seized up to $142,000 from the victims,
Herrera said.
   In another attack, gunmen killed a councilman in Caicedonia, 150
miles west of Bogota. A police report said it was not known if the
attack was mounted by guerrillas.
