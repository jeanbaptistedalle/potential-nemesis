   A Thai Airways Boeing 747 made an unscheduled
landing here after two of its three inertial navigation systems
malfunctioned and the plane flew more than 600 miles off course,
the Federal Aviation Administration said.
   The errant Flight 741, en route from Seattle to Tokyo, was
spotted by the Anchorage International Airport air-traffic control
center, said FAA spokesman Paul Steucke.
   He said a controller gave directions to the nearest FAA
navigation aid, at St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea, about 800
miles southwest of Anchorage, so the captain of the jet could
establish its location.
   After learning that the plane carrying 319 people lacked fuel to
reach Tokyo, the controller provided directions to Anchorage,
Steucke said.
   Problems with the jetliner's inertial navigation systems were
discovered when FAA inspectors checked them after the plane reached
Anchorage, he said.
   The navigation devices were replaced in Anchorage and the plane
continued on to Seattle, where passengers transfered to a
Tokyo-bound flight, officials said.
   In 1983, Korean Airlines Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet
warplane after it ranged more than 100 miles off course over the
Siberian island of Sakhalin, killing all 269 people aboard.
   It was speculated at the time that a failure of the plane's
navigation systems might have figured in the course error, but a
federal jury ruled in August that the victims' families could
collect damages for the flight crew's ``willful misconduct.''
