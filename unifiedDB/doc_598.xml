   Subway Sandwiches and Salads, a fast-growing
chain of restaurants specializing in submarine sandwiches, was the
top-ranked North American franchise in 1989 for the third
consecutive year, according to Entrepreneur magazine.
   The magazine, which publishes it 11th annual franchise rankings
in its January issue appearing newstands on Dec. 28, said Tuesday
that eight of the top 10 franchises were in the fast-food category.
   ``It demonstrates the American emphasis on convenience,'' Rieva
Lesonsky, editor of the Irvine, Calif.-based magazine, said in a
telephone interview.
   Second was Domino's Pizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
followed by McDonald's Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill.; Little Caesar's
Pizza, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., and Burger King Corp.,
based in Miami.
   The magazine compiles its rankings by using a number of factors,
including number of years in franchising, number of franchised
versus company-owned units, startup costs and growth rate.
   Ms. Lesonsky said Subway, which is based in Milford, Conn., has
grown to 3,610 franchised restuarants in 1989 from 1,375 in 1987.
   The restaurant's appeal, she said, is that it serves ``fast
food, but it's healthy and Americans are a little more tuned in to
health these days.''
   Rounding out the top 10 are Dairy Queen, Minneapolis; Arby's
Inc., Atlanta; Chem-Dry Carpet, Drapery &amp; Upholstery Cleaning,
Cameron Park, Calif.; Hardee's, Rocky Mount, N.C.; and Century 21
Real Estate Corp., Irvine, Calif.
