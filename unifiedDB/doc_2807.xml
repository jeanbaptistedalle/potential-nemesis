   Actress Madoline Thomas, a veteran of the National
Theater and the Royal Shakespeare Company, died Saturday, three
days before her 100th birthday, Press Association reported.
   Miss Thomas had been in a hospital in Weston-super-Mare, on
England's west coast, for more than a week after breaking her hip
in a fall at the nursing home where she had lived for three years,
the British news agency said.
   No cause of death was given.
   Born in Abergavenny, South Wales, Miss Thomas was an amateur
singer, pianist and actress before going onto the professional
stage when she was widowed at 52.
   She spent six seasons with the Royal Shakespeare Company at
Stratford-on-Avon, notably in ``Wars of the Roses,'' and five years
at the National, where she played in ``Tales from the Vienna
Woods.''
   In 1982, when she was 92, she appeared in National's ``Uncle
Vanya,'' directed by Sir Peter Hall.
   Her West End appearances included ``The Mousetrap'' and ``Three
Sisters.''
   No survivors were listed and funeral plans were not announced.
