   The number of working U.S. oil and gas rigs
climbed 25 to total 1,079 after slipping by four last week, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported.
   The latest rig count is up from the 930 a year ago, the company
reported Monday.
   Baker Hughes' rig count, a widely watched industry index of
drilling activity, reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively
producing oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10
per 42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes
began compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas showed the largest gain
with seven, followed by Wyoming, six; Louisiana, four; Kansas and
New Mexico, three each; North Dakota, two; and Colorado, one.
   California fell by five and Oklahoma slipped by two from last
week. Michigan and Pennsylvania were unchanged.
