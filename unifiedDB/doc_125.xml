   Lee Van Cleef, the hawk-faced actor whose
first movie gunbattle was opposite Gary Cooper in the classic
Western ``High Noon,'' has died at age 64.
   Van Cleef collapsed at his Oxnard home late Friday, said Craig
Stevens, a Ventura County deputy coroner.
   Van Cleef's wife, Barbara, called paramedics. He was pronounced
dead early Saturday at St. John's Regional Medical Center in
Oxnard, a scenic coastal community 60 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The actor had a history of heart disease and had a pacemaker
implant, Stevens said.
   Born Jan. 9, 1925 in Somerville, N.J., Van Cleef dropped out of
high school to serve on submarine chasers and mine sweepers in the
Navy.
   After his discharge in 1946, he worked as a farmer, gas station
attendant, painter and accountant before taking his first stage
role. Later, he won a place in the road company of the play, ``Mr.
Roberts.''
   Van Cleef's film break came when he was cast as steely-eyed Jack
Colby, one of four desperadoes faced down by Cooper in the 1952
movie ``High Noon'' that also starred Grace Kelly. He later became
a familiar gunslinger in so-called spaghetti Westerns made by
Italian director Sergio Leone, including ``The Good, the Bad and
the Ugly.''
   His agent, Tom Jennings, said Van Cleef never became a film idol
because he abandoned Hollywood for Europe.
   ``I think he could have beena greater movie star, as big as
Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood, had he come back from Europe
sooner than he did. But he liked working abroad,'' said Jennings.
   ``He wasn't the ambitious killer-type star, always going after
the gold ring. He did his own thing.''
