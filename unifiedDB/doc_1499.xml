   A group of powerful investors, including oil
fortune heir Gordon P. Getty, increased its stake Friday in Avon
Products Inc. to 8.7 percent and extended its credit agreement with
several banks.
   Chartwell Associates, a limited partnership, said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it paid $14.5
million to purchase 401,000 more shares of Avon common stock
between Dec. 1 and last Tuesday.
   The stock, purchased for between $35.25 and $36.62{ per share,
increased Chartwell's holdings to 4.9 million shares for a total of
$166.3 million.
   The SEC filing said the partnership has extended its credit
agreement so it can continue borrowing until Jan. 31, 1990.
   Avon, a New York-based cosmetics company, has twice rejected
takeover proposals earlier this year and fended off takeover
feelers from Dallas-based Mary Kay Corp., the privately held parent
of door-to-door marketer Mary Kay Cosmetics.
   A subsidiary of Mary Kay is among the general partners of
Chartwell, which also include the Gordon P. Getty Family Trust and
the Fisher real estate family of New York.
