   Soybean futures prices closed slightly higher
Thursday in a quiet session on the Chicago Board of Trade while
grain futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Support for the soybean market stemmed from a mood among traders
that after three straight days of losses, the market was oversold
and due for rebound, analysts said.
   Some buying also was linked to the Census Bureau's weekly
soybean crush report, which showed lower stocks of soybean meal and
soybean oil than the market had expected.
   The soybean market opened lower, rallied at midday, then ``laid
there like a dead fish for most of the rest of the session,'' said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago.
   Trading activity was very thin in the corn, wheat and oat
markets. Sub-zero temperatures in Chicago kept some traders away
while others got an early start on the holiday weekend.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to \ cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.12{ a bushel; corn
futures were } cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.38} a
bushel; oats were } cent to 2\ cents higher with March at $1.54{ a

$5.74{ a bushel.
