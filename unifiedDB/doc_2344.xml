   A chartered Romanian airliner on a
relief mission crashed Thursday in bad weather about 40 miles from
Bucharest, killing seven people, including a British free-lance
photographer, news reports said.
   Ian Parry, on assignment for The Sunday Times, was the only
passenger on the Romanian Airlines Tarom aircraft, which was bound
for Belgrade to collect medical supplies.
   Independent Television's Channel 4 news reported that the
plane's six-member Romanian crew also was killed.
   The Romanian news agency Agerpres said the plane, a Soviet-built
Antonov-24 was trying to open the first international air link ``of
new Romania'' when it crashed at Gaiesti near Bucharest because of
bad weather.
   A commission of experts went to the site to investigate the
cause of the crash.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said the plane took off for
Belgrade to bring a new consignment of Yugoslav humanitarian aid
for Romania.
   Parry, 24, was trying to get his film back to London.
   The Sunday Times said Parry asked to cover the events in Romania
and arrived on Monday.
   ``Ian Parry was young, dedicated and undoubtedly a rising star.
He had argued to go into Romania, feeling it was an opportunity
which should not be missed,'' said Roy Greenslade, managing editor
for news of The Sunday Times.
