   Comic Jackie Mason and Mayor-elect David Dinkins
made up at a holiday party, although Mason couldn't resist a few
wisecracks.
   Mason got in hot water in September for calling Dinkins ``a
fancy shvartze with a moustache'' while working on the campaign of
Dinkins' opponent, Republican Rudolph Giuliani. Shvartze is a
derogatory Yiddish word for a black.
   The comedian, with Dinkins by his side, said Saturday he was
glad Dinkins won the mayoral race.
   ``I'm on his side as much as I would've been if I'd been on his
side from the beginning,'' he said. ``I know he's going to call on
me for help a lot, and if he doesn't I'm still going to help.''
   ``There has never been bad blood,'' Dinkins said.
   Before Dinkins arrived at the party for the families of
firefighters killed in the line of duty, Mason joked with reporters
about a report that Dinkins has asked to be called ``Mr. Dinkins,''
rather than ``Dave,'' at news conferences.
   ``They called Truman `Harry.' They called Reagan `Ronnie.' Maybe
if he doesn't like his name, they could call Dinkins `Jackie' and
call me `Dave,''' Mason said.
