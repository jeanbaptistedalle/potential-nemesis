   The famous leaning tower of Pisa shifted less
this year than its average annual tilt of the last three decades,
university technicians said Thursday.
   The inclination of the 180-foot tower was about 0.03 inches,
compared to an average 0.045 inches recorded over the past 30
years, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.
   ``(The measuring instruments) are set for very small values,
which show that the tower is slowing its fall,'' said Gero Geri, a
topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower
since 1969.
   His findings are reassuring to the shopowners, merchants and
hoteliers who depend on the 800,000 tourists who clamber up the
tower's spiral staircase every year. Nonetheless, Pisa's mayor
recently agreed to close the tower starting next month for
temporary restoration work.
   The tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173, started to lean
almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath. The tower
now tilts about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but tower experts
say it will not topple for at least another century.
   Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini sparked an outcry this
fall by sounding an alarm about the decay of the national symbol.
