   The dollar was lower in quiet, late-morning
trading in Europe today, and gold prices also fell.
   Traders attributed the dollar's weaker tone mostly to
expectations that U.S. interest rates will decline further.
   ``It's a continuation of a trend already in place, but which has
been renewed by expectation of easing U.S. monetary policy,'' said
a trader in Milan, Italy.
   Traders said, however, that the market was very thin with
activity limited to small, end-of-the-year commercial orders.
   The European markets were closed Monday and Tuesday for
Christmas.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from
Tuesday. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 141.85
yen.

   _1.6885 West German marks, down from 1.7090
   _1.5310 Swiss francs, down from 1.5475

   _1.9110 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9330
   _1,266.00 Italian lire, down from 1,277.75
   _1.1590 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1585
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6305 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6205 late Friday.
