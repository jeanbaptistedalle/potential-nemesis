   Malaysian authorities today began
ferrying 26,000 illegal immigrants home to obtain proper documents
so they can return here to work.
   Director General of Immigration Syed Alwi Syed Nordin was at
Malacca port, 90 miles southwest of Kuala Lumpur, to send off the
first batch of 76 Indonesians.
   It will take the government about a year to send back all 26,000
Indonesian illegal immigrants registered with his department, the
national news agency Bernama quoted him as telling reporters there.
An average of 500 will be sent back weekly across the Malacca
Straits, he added.
   Most will be sent to Dumai, on Indonesia's Sumatra Island, where
it would take two days for them to obtain valid Indonesian travel
documents, he said. The first batch was expected back Sunday in
Malacca.
   On their return, they were to be issued Malaysian visas and
three-year work permits, which could be renewed if necessary.
   Syed said that to keep track of the Indonesian workers in
Malaysia, the government had urged them to register with the
authorities so that they could be issued legal documents. The
Indonesian government had been consulted and agreed to this, he
added.
   The 26,000 who have registered mostly worked on palm oil, rubber
and other plantations.
