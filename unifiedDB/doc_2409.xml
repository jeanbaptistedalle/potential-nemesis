   A United Mine Workers spokesman terms
as ridiculous a lawsuit filed by a strikebound coal company
alleging the union's selective strike program is a thinly veiled
racketeering operation.
   The $60 million lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Beckley by New Beckley Mining Corp., which also announced
it is closing its Glen Daniel Mine in Raleigh County because of
alleged union violence, including ``murderous attacks on
employees.''
   ``The decision to shut down and seal New Beckley's Glen Daniel
Mine was reached because the continued organized violence
orchestrated against New Beckley by the UMWA has reached an
intolerable level of acceptibility by any rational standard,'' said
New Beckley President Jay Sasell at a press conference.
   ``Marauding pickets continue to cause great hardship upon the
company and its families on a daily basis. We are disappointed that
the UMWA has chosen this path of destruction of a fine company,
forcing us to take these severe steps to prevent further harm to
our employees,'' Sasell said.
   The UMW has been on strike against New Beckley since January,
idling 130 miners, and also is engaged in a bitter strike against
the Pittston Coal Group Inc. in West Virginia, Virginia and
Kentucky.
   The 53-page lawsuit cites alleged violence at more than 20 coal
companies in West Virginia, Kentucky and Virginia since 1983, when
the union began its selective strike strategy, in which the UMW
targets specific companies for work stoppages. Previous strikes
were industrywide.
   The suit alleges New Beckley employees have been the victims of
vandalism, death threats, shootings and beatings at work and at
home.
   ``Indeed, the violence affects not one company or group of
companies, but rather pervades the coal industry, discouraging
productivity and inhibiting the economic well-being of individuals
living and working in coal-producing communities,'' the suit says.
   ``That's ridiculous,'' said union spokesman John Duray, who
accused the company of engaging in a ``press-release lawsuit'' by
hiring a public relations company to notify the media of the filing.
   ``It looks to me like these guys are a lot more interested in
trying their case in the media than in court,'' Duray said.
   UMW District 29 President Everett Acord said he knew nothing of
the lawsuit or the mine closing, although he said it isn't
unprecedented for a company to close a mine that is being struck.
   The suit, filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Act, contends the union has engaged in a
pattern of racketeering that includes 34 counts of attempted
murder, 23 counts of arson and 79 counts of extortion.
   Under the RICO statute, the company's requested $20 million in
damages can be tripled if the union and various individuals are
found to have violated the act.
