<HEAD>Texas Investigators Probe Suspicious Fire, Neo-Nazi Graffiti at Black
Church</HEAD>

   Neo-Nazi graffiti has been found at a
small black church that was heavily damaged by a suspicious fire
Christmas Eve, and authorities said they were investigating.
   The fire at the Cedar Grove Missionary Baptist Church in this
Dallas suburb started outside and appeared to have been set, said
Jeff Bryant, one of four Ellis County Sheriff's Department
investigators probing the fire.
   The blaze burned about a fourth of the church's pews and did
about $15,000 in damage, Bryant said.
   The Rev. S.E. Shead, the church's pastor, said members of the
congregation found five swastikas painted on church property while
surveying the damage Tuesday. Shead said he believed the fire was
racially motivated.
   The swastikas were painted on the church's front steps, a
portable sign in front and a propane tank near the spot where the
fire began, he said. They were not there when church members left
Sunday afternoon following Christmas Eve services.
   Authorities are trying to determine whether the fire and
graffiti are connected, Bryant said.
   The investigator said the symbols are not correct depictions of
the Nazi swastika.
   ``They are not the pattern of an educated neo-Nazi,'' he said.
   Information gathered by the sheriff's department will be turned
over to the state fire marshal's office, Bryant said.
   About 30 people attend the church in Red Oak, a sparsely
populated area near Waxahachie, which is about 40 miles south of
Dallas.
