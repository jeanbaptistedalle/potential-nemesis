   Two cars collided on a West Texas highway
Sunday, killing seven people, police said.
   The crash occurred on U.S. Highway 67 about 27 miles south of
Marfa when a vehicle carrying one man crossed the center line and
struck the other vehicle, which was carrying six people, said
Department of Public Safety Trooper Mark Riordan.
   The identities of four of the victims were withheld until
relatives could be notified. The others, all occupants of the
second car, were identified as Richard L. Armendariez, 29, Noe
Armendariez Molinar, 27, and Vanessa Armendariez, 8. All were from
Rankin, but their relationship was not immediately known, police
said.
   ``I would have to say this is probably the worst collision since
the bus crash,'' Riordan said, referring to the September school
bus crash in Alton, Texas, that killed 21 students.
   In Flagstaff, Ariz., fog and ice were blamed for Saturday's
62-vehicle chain pileup that killed six people, injured 34 and kept
sections of Interstate 40 closed for 17 hours.
   Twenty-four people remained hospitalized Sunday, four in
critical condition, authorities said.
