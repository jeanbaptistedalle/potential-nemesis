   Two fights broke out among Vietnamese at a
detention camp Thursday night, killing one person and injuring 10,
police said.
   The cause of the fights, which police said were quickly ended by
police and involved about 150 men, was not clear.
   The injured were hospitalized and police were investigating. No
one was arrested.
   In the last few months, many fights have broken out among the
Vietnamese, but all were brought under control quickly by the
police.
   About 56,000 Vietnamese boat people are housed in squalid camps
in Hong Kong. About 12,000 of them who arrived before June 1988 are
considered refugees eligible for resettlement, but those who
arrived after that are being screened. If they are classified as
illegal immigrants, they must either go back home voluntarily or be
repatriated by force to Vietnam.
   More than 50 were repatriated against their wishes earlier this
month.
