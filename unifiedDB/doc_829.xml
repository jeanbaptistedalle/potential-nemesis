   Iran protested to Britain on Wednesday
about British plans to deport two Iranian students suspected of
planning to kill Indian-born Salman Rushdie, author of the novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tehran television said Iran's Foreign Ministry sent an official
protest to London through the Swedish Embassy, which looks after
Iranian interests in Britain.
   Tehran also condemned the arrest of two other Iranians who were
freed late Tuesday.
   Iran cut ties with Britain last February after Britain protested
a death sentence imposed on Rushdie, a British citizen, by Iran's
revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Khomeini said ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam, provoking a
worldwide furor over the book.
   The four Iranians were arrested Friday under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, which gives police the right to hold them for seven
days without charge.
   The Home Office said Tuesday that engineering students Karen
Abrinia, 32, and Mehrdad Kokabi, 33, were being deported for
``reasons of national security.'' It did not elaborate.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
students' lawyer, Zahir Aziz, as saying they believed they were
arrested because they were suspected of planning to assassinate
Rushdie, who remains in hiding.
   The two freed Iranians were identified as Hussein Gharibi and
Javad Mousavi, 40, a disabled father of four children.
   Both IRNA and Tehran TV were monitored in Nicosia.
