   A house fire claimed the lives of three
children while their mother was with friends wrapping Christmas
presents, authorities said Thursday.
   The Nickels family moved to Maine in September from California,
following the death of the children's father in a car crash. The
family's home had been burglarized soon after they moved here, Fire
Chief Duane Brasslett said.
   When firefighters arrived at their house late Wednesday,
16-year-old Michael Nickels was yelling for help from a third-story
window. He told firefighters there were other children inside.
   He died along with Laura Ann Nickels, 4, and brother Brian, 6,
said Fire Capt. David Martin. A brother, David, 11, jumped out a
second-story window to escape the flames, Martin said.
   Michael fell inside the building and could not be immediately
rescued. He died on the way to a hospital, said the chief.
   Their mother, Jennifer Nickels, was with friends in nearby Old
Town wrapping Christmas presents, officials said.
   Autopsies were planned. The house was gutted, and Brasslett said
the cause of the fire was not known.
