   Consumer prices in the 12 European
Community nations rose by an average of 0.4 percent in November,
slowing from a 0.6 percent increase in October, the economic bloc
said Thursday.
   Its statistical bureau said EC inflation would be about 5.5
percent for 1989, up from 4.4 percent in 1988 and 3.4 percent in

percent, and in Britain and Greece, with 0.9 percent each.
   Prices were unchanged in the Netherlands, while the consumer
