   Gov. Rose Mofford underwent surgery Monday to
have her infected gallbladder removed and to clear blockages
believed to have been caused by gallstones.
   Surgery began at 12:20 p.m. and was expected to last two hours,
said Debra Gelbart, a spokeswoman for St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center.
   ``We think that surgery is the best option at this time,''
Robert Bullington, a cardiologist and Mrs. Mofford's primary
physician said shortly before surgery began. ``She feels herself
that surgery is the best option.''
   The operation's chief surgeon, Victor Zannis, said that there
was ``over a 90 percent chance that she's going to be just fine.''
   Mrs. Mofford probably will have to remain in the hospital for
seven to 10 days after surgery but should be able to work from her
bed and could recover to deliver her State of the State address
Jan. 8, the doctors said.
   Mrs. Mofford, 67, checked herself into St. Joseph's on Sunday
complaining of chest pains. Tests showed that the pain came from an
infected gallbladder and irritated pancreas, said Michael Altman, a
gastroenterologist.
   Tests suggest that Mrs. Mofford was suffering from gall stones
and that one or more of them had made its way from the gallbladder
through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct where it
blocked the pancreatic duct long enough to irritate the pancreas,
Altman said.
   Mrs. Mofford's doctors said her family had a history of
gallbladder and heart problems. The hospital said Monday that the
governor was in stable condition and was not in pain.
