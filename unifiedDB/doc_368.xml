   Ford Motor Co. on Monday recalled 64,115
cars and light trucks because of emission system problems.
   The company said it was recalling 64,000 1986 model Lincoln Town
Cars, Continentals and Mark VIIs; Ford Crown Victoria, Thunderbird
and Mustang; Mercury Grand Marquis, Cougar and Capri and some 1987
Lincoln Mark VII cars with 5-liter or 5-liter, high-output engines.
   Ford said testing by the California Air Resources Board showed
emissions of hydrocarbon to be too high. The company will replace
fuel injectors and other equipment.
   In a separate action, Ford recalled 115 1989 model F-250 and
F-350 light trucks with 5.8-liter engines and manual transmissions
which may emit too much carbon monoxide.
   Owners in both actions are being notified by mail and repair
work will be performed free of charge.
