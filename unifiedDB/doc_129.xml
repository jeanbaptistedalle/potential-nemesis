   'Tis the season to count our follies.
   The Dubious Achievement Awards of 1989 are out, courtesy of
January's Esquire magazine.
   ``Fright of the Year'' goes to fallen hotel queen Leona
Helmsley, ``Blight of the Year'' to the Batman logo, ``Flight of
the Year'' to author-on-the-lam Salman Rushdie, and banned baseball
biggie Pete Rose wins ``Troglodyte of the Year.''
   ``Invite of the Year'' is awarded to Malcolm Forbes for his
birthday extravaganza in Morocco, dubbed ``Rich Mammals on
Camels,'' and the savings and loan industry receives the ``Parasite
of the Year'' award.
   The magazine commends John F. Kennedy Jr. for paying $2,000 in
parking tickets before becoming an assistant district attorney in
Manhattan, and jibes Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, for rejoining all
three of the exclusive clubs he resigned from during the 1988
presidential campaign.
   Donald Trump's plans for a new television game show called Trump
Card is termed ``One Reason to Go On Living.''
   For its part, this week's People magazine weighs in with a
``Field of Bad Dreams.''
   ``Zsa Zsa Gabor struck out swinging,'' People said, while ``Jim
Bakker and Leona Helmsley complained loudly about the umpiring as
they were thumbed out.''
   The magazine commends actor Rob Lowe for ``his career in the
minors,'' and ``Silent Sam,'' former Housing and Urban Development
Secretary Samuel Pierce, who ``went quietly, humming the Fifth
Amendment all the way to the lockers.''
