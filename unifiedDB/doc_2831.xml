   An America West jetliner skidded off the
end of the runway at Tucson International Airport on Saturday
night, and three of 127 people aboard were hurt, authorities said.
   The Boeing 737, Flight 450 from Phoenix, apparently lost
hydraulic pressure while landing at 7:05 p.m. (9:05 p.m. EST),
airport spokeswoman Paula Morgan said.
   The plane carried 122 passengers and a crew of five, said Dick
Shimizu, an America West spokesman at company headquarters in Tempe.
   One passenger complained of chest pains after the landing and
two complained of neck injuries, Ms. Morgan said. They were taken
to hospitals. Shimizu said nobody who was injured was hospitalized
overnight.
   The airliner ended up nose down about 100 yards west of the
airport perimeter fence after the nose gear collapsed, Ms. Morgan
said.
   Passengers were removed from the plane through emergency chutes
on the side. Emergency equipment was rushed to the scene.
   Bill Kuhn, 19, of Tucson, who was at the airport waiting for a
friend from Tennessee and watched the landing, said: ``The plane
just flew down the runway, it wasn't stopping. I immediately knew
something was wrong.''
   He said airport officials told relatives and friends that the
plane suffered an hydraulic leak and that the tires blew, causing
it to go off the runway. Ms. Morgan also said the rough landing was
related to an hydraulic leak.
