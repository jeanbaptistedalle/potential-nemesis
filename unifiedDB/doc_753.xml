   A drug counselor was arrested on charges of
offering an abuser on probation a drug-free jar of urine in
exchange for a Mercedes.
   David Holland, 36, of Maple Shade, N.J., was taken into custody
Tuesday on theft and bribery charges after accepting the keys and
signing the title to a $28,000 Mercedes provided by investigators
tipped off to the alleged offer.
   Holland, who was freed on $5,000 bail, is a counselor at
Consortium, which has a city contract to provide drug-treatment
programs.
   The district attorney's office said Holland told an unidentified
19-year-old on probation for drug possession that he faced a jail
term because of his drug-tainted urine. Holland offered a drug-free
sample, authorities said.
   The man, who was required to undergo treatment at Consortium as
part of his probation, thought the price was too steep and reported
it to his lawyer, who notified the district attorney's office.
   Investigators put the man in a Mercedes that had been forfeited
in drug raids.
