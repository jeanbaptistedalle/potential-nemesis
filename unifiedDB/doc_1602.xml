<HEAD>State Department: U.S. Supports New Romanian Government</HEAD>

   The United States is seeking ways to supply
further emergency medical assistance to the new, pro-democracy
government in Romania, the State Department said Saturday.
   ``The United States supports the newly constituted Romanian
government and its commitment to democratic reforms,'' a statement
issued by the department said.
   In Bucharest on Saturday, provisional government leaders said
they captured deposed President Nicolae Ceausescu and they pledged
to put Eastern Europe's last Stalinist dictator on trial for
persecuting the nation.
   The National Salvation Committee, the name of Romania's
provisional revolutionary governing coalition, has announced a
program of democratic reform. The State Department said the United
States views the provisional government as ``the manifestation of
the democratic will of the Romanian people.''
   It called on remaining Ceausescu supporters, including members
of the secret police, to ``lay down their arms and put an end to
the tragic bloodshed in Romania.''
   Humanitarian aid already has been offered by the United States
and efforts are being made to supply further medical assistance,
the State Department said.
   U.S. officials are consulting with allies and others, including
the Soviet Union, on the evolving situation, the statement said.
   ``The United States calls on the international community to
offer its moral and political support to the cause of democracy in
Romania,'' the State Department said.
