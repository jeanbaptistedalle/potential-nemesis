   Microsoft Corp.'s president and chief
operating officer has announced he will retire June 30, the end of
the company's current fiscal year.
   Jon A. Shirley will continue to have a role in the company's
management as a member of the board of directors and as a
consultant for strategic projects, the company said in a news
release Wednesday.
   ``I'm looking forward to having more time for personal matters
while maintaining a useful role with Microsoft,'' Shirley said.
   Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive officer,
said: ``Jon has been instrumental to the growth of the company. We
are sorry to lose him as president but are pleased that he will
continue to be a contributor and a valuable resource to the senior
management of this company.''
   Shirley has been president since August 1983 and will help
company officials choose his successor, Gates said.
   Prior to joining Microsoft, Shirley was vice president of
computer merchandising at Tandy Corp.
   Microsoft, headquartered in this eastern suburb of Seattle,
develops, markets and supports a variety of computer software for
business and professional use.
