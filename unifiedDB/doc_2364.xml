   Unfavorable weather Thursday night
forced the seventh postponement of the maiden launch of Martin
Marietta Corp.'s commercial Titan 3 rocket.
   Company officials reported winds about 30,000 feet above the
launch area were too high and the temperature on the ground was a
few degrees too cold.
   A Titan 3 launch requires a reading of at least 62 degrees to
preserve the resiliency of synthetic O-rings between joints in the
two solid fuel rocket boosters.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:06 p.m. EST Friday. It was
originally scheduled for Dec. 7, but a combination of bad weather
and technical problems resulted in repeated delays.
   The Titan 3 is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and the British Ministry for Defence.
