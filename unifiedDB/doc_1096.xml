   The Communist youth movement dismissed
its leadership Thursday and chose a 26-year-old graduate as chief.
Those ousted included the granddaughter of disgraced former party
boss Todor Zhivkov.
   The official news agency BTA said the changes were made at a
12-hour meeting that lasted until 3 a.m. Thursday
   Rossen Karadimov, a 26-year-old law graduate now studying
philsophy at Sofia University, was elected the new leader of the
youth movement, which traditionally has been a stepping stone to
high rank in the Communist Party.
   BTA said Karadimov has been a party member since 1984.
   Former leader Evgeni Ouzounov and five other secretaries were
relieved of their posts, the agency said. It said Zhivkov's
granddaughter, Zheni Slavkova, was dismissed from the governing
bureau and his son, Vladimir, stripped of the title of honorary
member of the youth group's policy-making Central Committee.
   Zhivkov, 78, and his family have lost all their power since he
was ousted as party chief Nov. 10 after ruling Bulgaria for 35
years.
   In its brief report on the youth movement meeting, BTA said it
decided to hold a special congress Feb. 24.
   Zhivkov's successor as president and party chief, Petar
Mladenov, has outlined plans to remove the party's guarantee of
exclusive power from the constitution and hold free elections by
May.
