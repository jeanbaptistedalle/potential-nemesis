   American Express Bank Ltd., the international
banking arm of financial giant American Express Co., said Thursday
it agreed to sell its Geneva subsidiary to a Swiss firm for $1
billion in cash.
   The sale of TDB American Express Bank to privately held
Compagnie de Banque et d'Investissements will allow American
Express to focus on more established businesses overseas, said G.
Richard Thoman, president of American Express International Corp.
   ``Our goal is to concentrate on global businesses where we are
already market leaders _ card products, travelers checks, travel
services and financial services ... and to seek partnerships that
complement our businesses,'' Thoman said.
   American Express International was formed in July to help
American Express expand globally.
   Under terms of the agreement, TDB will be combined with CBI's
operation and a new bank called TCB-CBI will be formed. CBI will
own 80 percent of the new operation and American Express will hold
a 20 percent equity stake.
   American Express would not disclose how much it paid for that
minority stake.
   The new company will be headed by Edgar de Picciotto, managing
director and principal shareholder of CBI.
   The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
   American Express Bank has assets totaling $16 billion, including
$14.5 billion from client funds. The bank does not break down
assets of individual units.
