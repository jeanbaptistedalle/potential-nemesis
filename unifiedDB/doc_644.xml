   ABC's ``Roseanne'' reclaimed the top spot in
the Nielsen ratings and NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' fell to third
place. ``Married...With Children'' zoomed to 13th place.
   So far this season, ``Roseanne'' and ``Cosby'' each have won six
times. NBC's ``Cheers,'' which was second last week, has had one
first-place finish.
   The brash Al and Peg Bundy of ``Married...With Children''
flirted with the top 10 with their Christmas special.
   Its rating of 18.4 was Fox's best ever. Its 13th place finish
was better than Bob Hope's Christmas show on NBC, ABC's ``Who's the
Boss?'' and ``Coach,'' and NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night'' and
``Matlock.''
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 14.7. CBS had 12.6
and ABC 12.3. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television households tuned to a show.
   The second-place finish was CBS' best performance since the week
that ended Oct. 22.
   For the season, NBC leads with 14.9 to ABC's 13.2 and CBS' 12.3.
   Here's the top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``A Different World''; a
three-way tie for sixth place between NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' CBS'
``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years''; NBC's ``Dear John'' and
``L.A. Law.''
   The two-hour movie marking the return of CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' was 37th. The show's first regular episode was 54th.
   ABC maintained first place among evening news shows. ABC had a
rating of 11.0 to CBS' 10.4 and NBC's 10.2
