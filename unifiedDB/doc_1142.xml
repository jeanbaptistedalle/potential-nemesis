   After a bitter, seven-month battle, Unicorp
Canada Corp. and partner Cara Operations have abandoned their bid
for the world's largest doughnut-shop chain, Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   DD Acquisitions Corp., a partnership between Unicorp's
Kingsbridge Capital Group merchant bank subsidiary and Cara, said
it intends to tender its Dunkin' Donuts shares to Allied-Lyons PLC,
the British food company that made a rival bid last month.
   Dunkin' Donuts has accepted Allied-Lyons' bid of $47.25 per
share, or a total of $325 million, in cash.
   Kingsbridge President Earl Rotman said DD Acquisition had bought
860,000 Dunkin' Donuts shares at an average of $34 each and will
gain $11.4 million by tendering.
   Unicorp Canada Corp. and Cara Operations Ltd. launched their
assault in June, offering $43 per share for a minimum 50.1 percent
of Dunkin' Donuts' 6.85 million shares. The offer was increased to
$45 in August.
   Allied-Lyons' surprise bid was welcomed by management of the
chain, which is based in Randolph, Mass. Dunkin' Donuts had waged a
fight against Unicorp that included the adoption of a poison-pill
takeover defense in May.
   By tendering to Allied-Lyons, Unicorp suffered its second major
defeat this year, having failed to buy the Montreal-based Steinberg
Inc. grocery chain.
