<HEAD>Regulators Approve Gold Options, Oat Futures Options</HEAD>

   Plans to trade gold options and options on oat
futures contracts at two Chicago futures exchanges were approved
Tuesday by federal regulators.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
futures industry, approved the two plans unanimously, 5-0.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity,
like oats, at a specified price by a specified date.
   One of the approved proposals was for the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange to trade physical gold options.
   That will give the holder of a CME gold option contract the
right to buy or sell 100 troy ounces of gold at a specified strike
price on the delivery date.
   A strike price is the price at which an option holder can choose
to exercise the right to buy or sell the underlying futures
contract.
   The contract is designed to be a hedging instrument, whereby
producers, buyers and sellers of gold can lock in a favorable price
for transactions at a later date.
   The CFTC also approved a proposal by the Chicago Board of Trade
for trading options in its oats futures contracts. Holders of such
options will be able to buy or sell oat futures contracts on any
trading day prior to the contract's expiration. The trading months
will be based on the underlying futures delivery months of March,
May, July, September and December.
