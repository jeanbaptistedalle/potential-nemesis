   Discovery of an eagle's nest apparently
has complicated plans to build a $75 million hazardous waste
treatment plant.
   A state game warden found a pair of the birds nearly finished
building their nest this week in a tall pine on an 86-acre site in
central Florida where Florida First Processing Inc. wants to build
the plant.
   Bald eagles and their habitat are protected by federal and state
laws, said Don Palmer, a biologist in the Jacksonville office of
the federal Fish and Wildlife Service.
   The eagles were greeted with cheers from some of the 15 families
who live a half mile from the site 10 miles south of Mulberry and
bitterly oppose the plant.
   ``It's an answer to our prayers,'' said spokeswoman Sandra
Lancaster.
   Because federal and state laws prohibit relocating or disturbing
the endangered birds, the plant's developers could be barred from
building, according to federal and state wildlife authorities.
   ``Obviously we have to talk with the Fish and Wildlife bureau to
learn more about this,'' said Florida First vice president Ted
Leigh, who was unaware of the nesting eagles until Wednesday.
   Federal and state guidelines say development is prohibited
within a minimum of a 750-foot radius, or about 40 acres, of a
nest, Palmer said. Outside that, development up to a mile radius of
the nest can be restricted by federal officials.
