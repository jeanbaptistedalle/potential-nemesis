   Two teen-agers were arrested and charged today
with the drive-by shootings of two women who police said were
innocent victims of a turf battle among drug dealers near a housing
project.
   Eric Reed, 17, and Dwayne Faust, 16, both of the borough of
Queens, were charged with murder, assault, weapons violations and
reckless endangerment, said Sgt. Tina Mohrmann, a police
spokeswoman.
   They were arrested at 2:10 a.m., nearly 24 hours after they were
arrested at the scene of an unrelated shooting, she said.
   Reed and Faust were accused of killing Lysa Biffle, who was 26
and nine months pregnant, and Ebony Williams, 18, who was planning
to attend college next fall, on Christmas night shortly before
midnight.
   Ms. Williams was shot twice in the head as she and a friend were
making a call at a pay phone in Queens.
   Mrs. Biffle and her husband, Dwayne, 25, were shot as they were
getting into their car after visiting a relative. She gave birth to
a healthy boy by Caesarean section before she died. Biffle was
treated for a foot wound.
   Police say the neighborhood where the shootings occurred has
attracted gangs who fire at innocent people to show other drug
dealers that they are moving into the area.
   Reed and Faust were also charged with the attempted murder of
18-year-old Douglas Moore, who was seriously injured in a shooting
Friday morning that apparently resulted from an argument in a
parking lot, Mohrmann said.
