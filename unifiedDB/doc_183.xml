   A record number of endangered whooping
cranes, 146, have made the 2,500-mile annual journey from Canada to
the National Wildlife Refuge.
   ``Yes, we are ecstatic,'' refuge manager Brent Giezentanner said
recently.
   The 5-foot birds with snow-white plumes flocked from Wood
Buffalo National park in Alberta, Canada, to the Austwell refuge
along the Texas coast. Last year's flock consisted of 138 cranes.
   The whooping crane population has increased almost tenfold since
a low point in 1941, when 14 birds and two chicks were spotted on
refuge land. Since then, the population has slowly increased.
   Bird watchers and biologists credit public awareness and
protection of natural habitats in Canada and Texas with helping to
nurture the flock.
   President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized creations of the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in 1936 when it was discovered
only 14 adult cranes and four chicks were left in the species. It
also was discovered then that the Texas peninsula, covered with
blackjack oaks, was the birds' only known winter feeding area.
