<HEAD>Toyota Reportedly Expects Record Domestic Sales in 1990</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Toyoda is correct for president's name.</HEAD>

   Toyota Motor Corp. expects its 1990 domestic sales
to grow 8 percent from this year while exports remain stable,
President Shoichiro Toyoda was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Surging domestic demand will boost domestic sales for a seventh
consecutive year, to a record 2.48 million vehicles next year
compared with this year's estimated sales of 2.30 million, Kyodo
News Service quoted Toyoda as telling reporters.
   The predictions of Japan's largest automaker come in the face of
recent loss of market share due to the brisk performance of Nissan
Motor Co., Japan's No.2 automaker, which has been cutting into
Toyota's dominance in the domestic market, Kyodo noted.
   ``The strong growth expectation reflects Toyota's efforts to
recover its shrinking share in the domestic market in recent
years,'' Kyodo quoted Toyoda as saying.
   Toyota officials did not answer telephone calls Wednesday
evening.
   While Toyota's 8 percent domestic sales growth outpaces Nissan's
estimate of 4 percent growth in domestic sales to 1.37 million
vehicles next year, Nissan officials announced Tuesday they expect
overseas production to grow a hefty 7 percent in 1990 to 683,000.
   The Kyodo report did not quote Toyoda as mentioning Toyota's
overseas production.
   Toyota's exports are expected to remain flat at some 1.68
million units next year, Toyoda was quoted as saying.
   Nissan officials said their exports next year would increase
slightly by 0.2 percent to 1.07 vehicles.
   Toyota, which currently accounts for 41.8 percent of total
domestic sales, plans to boost its share to around 42.8 percent,
Kyodo quoted him as saying.
   Nissan says its share of Japan's is 23.8 percent but that it is
aiming for 30 percent, with growth of about 1 percent a year.
