   Rumors are circulating in Washington that
Colombian drug lords have put a $30 million price on President
Bush's head and have tried to recruit Middle East terrorists to
kill him, Newsweek reports.
   The magazine, in its Dec. 25 issue, also said the drug cartels
have sought Colombian guerrillas to raid U.S. targets.
   The information was attributed to a well-placed State Department
official, who said some of the reports have been investigated but
none checked out.
   Deputy White House press secretary Roman Popadiuk said Sunday he
knew nothing about the reports.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the reported bounty
credible.
   ``They have used these tactics against their own people and they
would resort to this kind of effort,'' he said.
   The senator added that he thought it unlikely that Bush would
back down from his plan to attend a drug summit in Colombia Feb. 15.
