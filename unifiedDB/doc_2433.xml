   KeyCorp Chairman and President Victor J. Riley
Jr. on Thursday was elected to serve a three-year term as a
director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   Riley was selected by middle-sized banks _ those with capital
and surplus between $30 million and $400 million _ in the second
Federal Reserve district to serve as one of the board's class A
directors, succeeding Alberto M. Paracchini, chairman of the Banco
de Ponce.
   The middle banks also re-elected John A. Georges, chairman of
International Paper, to a second term as a class B director.
   Each year a different group of banks elects two directors. Six
of the New York Fed's nine directors are elected by the district's
member banks. The class A directors, who control three seats, are
bankers. The remainder _ three class B and three class C directors
_ represent various interests including agriculture, commerce,
industry, services, labor and consumers.
   Separately, the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors
reappointed Cyrus R. Vance, a partner in the Simpson, Thacher &amp;
Bartlett law firm, as a class C director. He and Barnard College
President Ellen V. Futter were reappointed chairman and deputy
chairman, respectively, of the New York Fed's board.
   The appointments take effect Jan. 1.
