   The Treasury Department said today that final
agreement had been reached to provide Poland with a temporary loan
of up to $500 million to assist the country's economic reform
efforts.
   The money is being supplied by a group of Western nations, with
the U.S. share expected to total about $200 million, officials said.
   A Treasury statement said the $500 million short-term loan would
be used to assist the country until a larger $1 billion
stabilization fund for Poland became operational.
