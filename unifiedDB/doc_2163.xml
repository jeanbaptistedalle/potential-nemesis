   Here is a brief summary of events Wednesday in Panama:
   _ Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remained holed up in the Vatican
embassy in Panama City. A Vatican spokesman said he did not see how
Noriega could be turned over to the United States, which has no
extradition treaty with Panama.
   _ President Bush said negotiations to bring Noriega to trial
would continue. He appeared to leave open the possibility that
Noriega could be tried in Panama instead of the United States.
   _ U.S. soldiers set up powerful loudspeakers outside the Vatican
embassy, blaring music and radio news reports about negotiations
over Noriega's status.
   _ The U.S. Justice Department asked France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg and the United Kingdom to freeze bank accounts in which
Noriega is believed to have stashed more than $10 million in
``illegal drug money.'' France froze accounts in two banks holding
$3.3 million; Swiss officials placed a ``precautionary'' freeze on
two accounts.
   _ The Panama Canal, closed during the U.S. invasion, was
returning to normal gradually. Panama City residents returned to
work and lined up outside grocery stores.
   _ Panama's election commission certified that the U.S.-installed
president, Guillermo Endara, won the May 7 election that was
nullified by Noriega.
