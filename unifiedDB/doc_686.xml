<HEAD>Attorneys Say Woman's Remarriage Changes Embryo Appeal</HEAD>

   The woman who won control of seven
frozen human embryos in an unprecedented custody dispute has
remarried, and lawyers for her ex-husband say that could help them
when the case is appealed.
   Mary Sue Davis, who has been living in Florida since the August
divorce trial, married James Stowe in Cape Canaveral last week.
   Attorneys Janet Mayfield and Charles Clifford said the
remarriage could bolster their case of Junior Lewis Davis before
the state Court of Appeals.
   The lawyers said the remarriage renders moot two of Mrs. Davis'
contentions during the trial: that the seven embryos created by her
and Davis at a Knoxville fertility clinic last year might represent
her last chance to become pregnant and that fertilization clinics
would not take her as a client if she were single.
   ``My client always maintained this wasn't her last chance,'' Ms.
Mayfield said. ``If the court of appeals adopts the reasoning we'll
ask them to, to balance the interests of the two adults, then I
think the remarriage would affect the balance.''
   That was not, however, the reasoning adopted by the trial judge,
W. Dale Young of Blount County Circuit Court.
   Young ruled that the embryos are essentially unborn human beings
with rights of their own, and decided the case based on what he
felt was best for the embryos.
   ``Based on that ruling, this doesn't affect his reasoning at
all,'' Ms. Mayfield said.
   But, she said she believes Mrs. Davis' remarriage ``makes a
psychological difference to the court.''
   She said it will be the spring before the appeals court hears
the case.
