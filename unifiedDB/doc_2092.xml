   Three bodies were found this morning in
the wreckage of a small airplane that crashed in a rural section of
southern New Jersey, state police spokesman Daniel Cosgrove said.
   The Cessna 172 was spotted at 7:50 a.m. in the Wharton State
Forest.
   The plane had taken off from Teterboro Airport in northern New
Jersey on Monday night, headed to Norfolk, Va., and then to the
Bahamas, according to Maj. Andrew Pantelides of the New Jersey
Civil Air Patrol.
   The Cessna was traveling with two other planes that landed
safely in Atlantic City, Pantelides said. He said passengers aboard
those planes became concerned after the Cessna did not arrive and a
search began that night.
   Seven aircraft and about 65 rescue workers searched a 50 mile
area between Toms River and Atlantic City until the aircraft was
found this morning in Burlington County, Pantelides said.
   The names of the dead were not immediately released.
