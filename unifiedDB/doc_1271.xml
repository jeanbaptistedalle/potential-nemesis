<HEAD>FBI Disputes Tale of Hoffa Burial at Giants Stadium</HEAD>

   The FBI says it hasn't solved the disappearance
of Jimmy Hoffa, but isn't giving much credit to a mob informant's
story that the union leader was dismembered and buried under Giants
Stadium in New Jersey.
   After investigating a description of the ex-Teamsters union
leader's death by Donald ``Tony the Greek'' Frankos in the November
issue of Playboy magazine, the FBI said Thursday that evidence
doesn't support the account.
   Frankos claimed Hoffa was shot to death in the Detroit area, and
that his dismembered body was trucked to New Jersey and buried
under the football stadium, which was being built in East
Rutherford, N.J.
   ``We have conducted an investigation concerning his assertions
and cannot find any substantiation for what he said,'' said Hal
Helterhoff, special agent in charge of the FBI in Michigan. ``Never
say never, but it is a remote possibility he is buried there.''
   The Hoffa case remains open, Helterhoff said, adding that the
FBI was investigating statements by Frankos and other leads
unrelated to his story.
   The former Teamster leader disappeared without a trace in July
1975 outside a Detroit restaurant.
   FBI officials have said previously they believe Hoffa was slain
and know who did it but are unable to get proof.
   Helterhoff said parts of Frankos' story in Playboy were true,
but nothing specific about the alleged murder and burial of Hoffa
was substantiated. Agents investigated mob figures Frankos
mentioned and assessed times and dates to check his story,
Helterhoff said.
