<HEAD>Albania Denies Yugoslav Newspaper Report Of Demonstration</HEAD>

   Albania on Tuesday condemned as a
``fabrication'' a report in a Yugoslav newspaper about an alleged
demonstation in the Albanian city of Shkodra.
   The Belgrade daily Politika Ekspres on Tuesday quoted sources in
the southern province of Kosovo bordering Albania, as saying there
had been a demonstration in Shkodra, a town 50 miles north of the
capital Tirana near the Yugoslav border.
   The report said the protests took place in the last few days,
but added there was no reliable report on the reasons for the
alleged demonstrations.
   The Albanian state news agency ATA on Tuesday refuted the report
as ``invented, tendentious and ill-willing.''
   It said ``no kind of demonstration has been staged in the city
of Shkodra.''
   The Albanian ambassador to Vienna, Engyell Kolaneci, also
condemned the report as a ``fabrication'' which he said was
``untrue.''
   Relations between non-aligned Communist Yugoslavia and hard-line
Communist Albania have long been strained over the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo province. Albania alleges they are
discriminated against, but leaders in the republic of Serbia, of
which Kosovo is an adminstrative part, charge Albania with
interference in its internal affairs.
