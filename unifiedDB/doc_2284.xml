   Contract negotations to bring a veteran
television producer to the ``Today'' show have collapsed, network
officials said.
   Dave Nuell, the guiding force behind the syndicated program
``Entertainment Tonight,'' was to join ``Today'' as senior
executive producer on Jan. 8. But Michael Gartner, president of NBC
News, notified Nuell last Friday that negotiations were being
terminated.
   Nuell, a former news director at NBC's Washington station, WRC,
joined ``Entertainment Tonight'' in 1986 and is credited with
turning the troubled program into a top-rated show.
   He left the show several weeks ago in anticipation of the job at
NBC. He told The Washington Post that he ``had a three-year firm
deal that NBC reneged on. I intend to take every remedy I have to
try to repair the damage.''
   Gartner, in news release, said talks had gone on for three
months.
   ``We are disappointed that in the end, we were unable to reach
an agreement in a timely manner,'' Gartner said.
   Reportedly, the hangup involved questions about whether Nuell's
three-year, $2.7 million contract would be guaranteed.
   Peggy Hubble, an NBC spokesman, said only that the problems
involved ``some points in the contract that we didn't agree to.''
   She said that Marty Ryan, the executive producer of ``Today,''
would continue to act as producer as well.
