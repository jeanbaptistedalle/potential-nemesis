   Aspen Airways Inc. said Tuesday it reached an
agreement to sell aircraft and routes except for those serving the
ski resort of Aspen to Mesa Airlines Inc. Terms of the deal were
not released.
   Aspen Airways President Don Ringsby said transition is to begin
in mid-February and should be completed by June.
   Mesa Airlines, based in Farmington, N.M., said it will seek an
agreement with United Airlines to operate the former Aspen Airways
routes as a United Express carrier.
   The agreement covers Denver-based Aspen Airways' service in
Montrose, Colorado Springs, Durango, Gunnison and Grand Junction in
Colorado; Sheridan, Casper, Gillette and Jackson, Wyo.; and
Farmington.
   Ringsby said Aspen Airways would continue to serve Denver, Los
Angeles, Chicago and Dallas with four British Aerospace 146 jets,
which seat 86 passengers each.
   Mesa said it would offer jobs to all Aspen Airways employees in
those cities, and replace 10 Convair 580s Aspen Airways with new
aircraft. In addition, Aspen Airways' Denver station will handle
all Mesa Airlines' passengers in Denver.
   Mesa said in a statement the acquisition would add about $40
million to its revenue. Mesa reported revenue of $22.5 million
during fiscal year 1989.
