   Santa had a bit of trouble drawing his
gun from his costume but had no problem giving away a couple pairs
of stiff bracelets.
   ``Santa knows who's naughty and nice,'' police Sgt. Don Lacher
told David Villalobos, 26, as he stepped on his ankle during the
arrest Wednesday. ``I said: `Look, Santa says lay down on the
ground.'''
   Lacher, 35, was dressed as Santa and on his way to a gift
giveaway when he got a burglary call over his patrol car radio.
   Lacher and his uniformed partner, Officer Anthony Trout, rushed
to an apartment complex where they found a man and a woman loading
a car with nearly $2,000 worth of suspected stolen goods.
   The pair arrested Villalobos and Anna Marie Gallegos, 29, both
of Pomona, for investigation of burglary and possession of a loaded
firearm.
