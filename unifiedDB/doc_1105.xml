   Two earthquakes, including one measuring 6.0 on the
Richter scale, struck in the sea off northern Japan early Friday,
but no damage was reported.
   Police said there were no immediate reports of damage from the
quakes, which occurred within an eight-hour period.
   The first, at 1:50 a.m., was centered 12 miles under the seabed
in the central part of the Kuril Islands, the agency said.
   The Kurils are a group of 56 islands, all of volcanic origin,
extending 750 miles between Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main
island, and the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula.
   The second tremor, 24 miles below the ocean floor off northern
Ibaraki Prefecture, registered 4.6, officials said.
   The October killer quake that rattled the San Francisco Bay area
measured 7.1.
