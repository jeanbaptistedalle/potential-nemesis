   An Iranian oil tanker exploded
and caught fire today in the Atlantic northwest of the Canary
Islands and was reported sinking after its crew was rescued by a
Soviet freighter, officials said.
   The 284,632-ton Khark 5 sent out a distress signal at 5 a.m.
before its 35-man crew abandoned ship 350 miles from the Spanish
archipelago's capital and was picked up by the freighter Sarny,
Capt. David Rodriguez of the Las Palmas naval station said.
   Onda Pesquera, the Spanish ship-monitoring radio service based
in Barcelona, said the Soviet ship rescued the Iranian tanker's
crewmen and was expected to reach Las Palmas on Thursday.
   The Khark 5 forms part of the 19-vessel fleet operated by
state-run Iran National Tanker Co. It was twice attacked in the
Persian Gulf by Iraqi fighter-bombers during the Iran-Iraq war _
badly damaged by missiles March 3, 1987 and set afire on Feb. 5,
1988, with two crewmen wounded.
   Onda Pesquera director Jesus Ferreiro said there were no
immediate reports of injuries and the cause of the explosion was
not known. He said it was not known where the Iranian ship had been
headed.
   The Khark 5 was reportedly sinking, he said.
