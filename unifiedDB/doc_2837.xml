   Security guards on a Saudi Arabian
airliner overpowered a man Sunday who tried to force the pilot to
fly to Cyprus, where he said he planned to blow up the plane, the
Interior Ministry said.
   No weapons or explosives were found on the man, identified only
as a 32-year-old Saudi, according to an Interior Ministry statement
distributed by the official Saudi Press Agency.
   The statement did not explain how the man planned to force the
pilot to fly to Cyprus or destroy the plane operated by Saudi
Arabia's flag carrier, Saudia. The statement said the man might
have been under the influence of drugs.
   Thirty minutes after the airliner took off on a 600-mile flight
from Jiddah for the capital, Riyadh, the man gave a flight
attendant a note for the captain, the statement said.
   It demanded that the plane be flown to Larnaca, Cyprus, where
the hijacker and some companions would blow it up, the ministry
statement said.
   The pilot returned to Jiddah and when the plane landed, guards
overpowered the man and evacuated the passengers, the statement
said.
   The man was taken away for interrogation. The statement gave no
other details, such as the type of plane or how many people were
aboard.
