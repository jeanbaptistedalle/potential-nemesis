   Sea Containers Ltd. said Tuesday it had rejected
a sweetened $1.04 billion offer by Temple Holdings Ltd. in a
hostile battle for the ferry boat company.
   Sea Containers, which operates ferries in the English Channel,
said its board decided unanimously that its own recapitalization
plan ``provides greater value to the shareholders as a whole'' than
Temple's hostile cash offer.
   Temple, a Swedish and British ferry consortium, on Friday raised
its offer for the second time since it began its takeover bid in
May, this time to $70 a share from $63 a share for Sea Container's
common stock and to $112.70 a share from $101.43 a share for its
convertible preferred stock.
   Sea Containers initial offer totaled $824 million, or $50 a
share per common share and $80.50 for preferred.
   Sea Containers, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, said in a statement
it would proceed with a recapitalization plan offering $70 a share
to sellers of up to 7 million shares in an attempt to increase the
value of its stock.
   The company also said it had sold $733 million in assets to date
as part of the recapitalization plan, including the recent sale of
10 vessels for $92 million. Sea Containers plans to sell more than
$1 billion in assets to help thwart the takeover.
   Sea Containers also dismissed Temple's plan to hold a special
shareholders meeting to elect nominees to replace the current
board, saying Temple would be unable to gather the required
approval of 10 percent of holders of common shares.
   Temple Holdings Ltd. is owned by Sweden's Stena Holdings AG and
Britain's Tiphook PLC. Stena already owns about 8 percent of Sea
Containers stock.
