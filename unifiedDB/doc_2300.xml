   A cold wave in normally tropical
northern Bangladesh has killed at least 33 people in the past week,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Temperatures in the region have hovered at about 42 degrees
Fahrenheit since Monday, and the New Nation newspaper said the
victims were laborers and other poor people unable to protect
themselves from the cold.
   At least 18 people were reported killed in the Kurigram
district, 150 miles north of Dhaka, in the past three days, the
English-language daily said.
   Another 15 deaths were reported from the Pabna and Rangpur
districts, also in the north.
   Such low temperatures are rare in Bangladesh, which has a
tropical climate for most of the year. Its 110 million people are
among the world poorest and earn an average $160 per person per
year.
   Most people live in houses with mud floors and walls woven from
straw and bamboo, offering little protection from the cold. Many of
people who died in the cold spell had no houses.
