<HEAD>Government Rules Against Low-Cost Japanese Machine Imports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Commerce Department has ruled that imports
of mechanical transfer presses from Japan were being sold in the
United States at less than fair value.
   Mechanical presses are automatic metal-forming machine tools,
machines that are used to make other machines.
   With the ruling Wednesday by the Commerce Department, the U.S.
International Trade Commission now has 45 days to determine whether
the low-cost imports are injuring U.S. manufacturers of the same
products.
   If the commission finds that U.S. companies are being hurt, then
the Commerce Department will issue a final order imposing higher
duties on imports of the mechanical presses from Japan.
   The department proposed anti-dumping duties of 15.16 percent on
Komatsu Limited; 7.49 percent on Aida Engineering Limited and 14.51
percent on all other Japanese companies manufacturing the
mechanical presses.
   The U.S. investigation began last January after a complaint was
filed by the Verson Division of Allied Products Corp. Two unions,
the United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers, also
petitioned the government for relief.
   Imports of mechanical transfer presses from Japan totaled $109.2
million in 1988.
