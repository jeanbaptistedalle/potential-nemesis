   The government of President
Carlos Menem suffered an economic setback Tuesday when the
Argentine currency lost 27 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar in a single day.
   At the close of the business day, foreign exchange houses
offered 1,700 australs for each dollar. Last Friday, the market
rate was 1,230 australs per dollar. Banks were closed Monday for
Christmas.
   After weeks of pressure against the austral, the government Dec.
10 formally devalued the currency by 34 percent, bringing the
official and free market rates briefly in parity.
   However, the austral plunge anew after interest rates soared as
did prices and wage demands by workers. On Dec. 15, Economy
Minister Nestor Rapanelli resigned, and his successor, Antonio
Gonzalez, three days later freed the exchange rate and lifted most
price controls.
   Menem has struggled with the economy ever since taking office
July 8. Gonzalez is Menem's third economy minister, and Rodolfo
Rossi is the third Central Bank president.
   So far this year, Argentina has had six economy ministers and
five Central Bank presidents.
