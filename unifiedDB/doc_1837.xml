<TEXT>
   President and Mrs. Bush spent the Christmas
holiday with their five children and 11 grandchildren in the
splendid isolation of the snow-covered Catoctin mountains.
   Reports of their Christmas Day activities on Monday were scarce,
except that the White House let it be known that Bush had invited
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to Camp David, Md., to
brief the president on the situations in Panama and Romania.
   The president is scheduled to stay at Camp David until Wednesday.
   The children at the presidential retreat, 60 miles from
Washington, were George Walker Bush and wife Laura; John Ellis Bush
and wife Columba; Neil Mallon Bush and wife Sharon; Marvin Pierce
Bush and wife Margaret, and Dorothy Walker Bush.
