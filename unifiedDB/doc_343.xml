<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Japan's two largest automakers, Toyota Motor Corp.
and Nissan Motor Co., reported Monday that their exports fell more
than 15 percent in November from last year.
   Toyota Motor said its exports fell 17.0 percent to 123,834
vehicles, while its overseas production rose by 90.3 percent from a
year earlier to 52,108 vehicles.
   It said it sold 234,405 vehicles in Japan in November, up 12.6
percent from November 1988. It was the automaker's eighth
consecutive month-to-month increase in domestic sales, it said.
   Toyota held a 35.7 percent share of the Japanese market in
November, up 1.3 percentage points from November 1988, it said.
   Nissan, Japan's second-largest automaker, said its exports in
November fell 19.4 percent from a year earlier to 76,822 vehicles,
while its overseas production rose 5.1 percent to 56,653 vehicles.
   Nissan sold 113,452 vehicles in Japan in November, up 8.6
percent from a year earlier, it said, for a 22.1 percent share of
the Japanese market, down 1.3 percentage points.
   Nissan attributed the increase in domestic sales to business
prosperity in Japan and the decrease in exports to a slump in the
U.S. market and an increase in overseas production.
