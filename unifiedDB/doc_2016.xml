   Grain and soybean futures prices closed modestly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as temperatures in U.S.
growing areas rose, slowing feed-grain demand and easing
transportation problems.
   Soybeans for near-term delivery slipped below $5.70 a bushel for
the first time since early November. The soybean market had risen
sharply in recent weeks as temperatures fell in the Great Plains
and Midwest, reflecting the increased demand for soybean meal as a
high-energy livestock feed.
   Further selling of soybean futures was linked to reports of
light rain in southern Brazil over the weekend and forecasts for
more moisture in the region, one of the world's major
soybean-producing areas.
   It is early summer in Brazil. Dry weather during the planting
season had stirred drought fears, but those concerns have faded as
growing conditions have improved in recent weeks.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 1} cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $4.10 a bushel;
corn futures were { cent to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.38{ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1{ cents lower with March at $1.53\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1{ cents to 3} cents lower with January at
$5.68{ a bushel.
