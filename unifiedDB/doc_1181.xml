   Lee Apparel Co. will pay a $25,000 fine
and donate 1,000 pairs of new jeans to youth groups in Alabama to
settle a lawsuit that originally sought $1.3 million.
   Attorney General Don Siegelman announced the settlement at a
news conference Thursday that was attended by representatives of
several charity youth organizations that will receive the jeans.
   A lawsuit filed by Siegelman had accused the company of
violating the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act by attaching
American-made labels on jeans made in Costa Rica. It also claimed
the company attempted to place labels bearing the seal of the
United Garment Workers of America in jeans made in non-union shops.
   Siegelman said the $25,000 fine would be used to boost the
$500,000 annual budget of the consumer protection activities in his
office.
   ``With this being the Christmas season, the settlement could not
have come at a better time,'' Siegelman said.
   David Brown, a Lee Apparel Co. vice president, said the company
was happy with the settlement. He said there was ``absolutely no
ill will involved'' in the change of the labels.
   ``It was a consequence of human error, an error in judgment,''
he said.
