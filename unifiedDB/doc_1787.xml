   The bodies of two more U.S.
servicemen killed in Panama were returned to Dover Air Force Base
on Christmas Day, the 22nd and 23rd since the U.S. invasion began
last week.
   The bodies were flown aboard a transport plane from Howard Air
Force Base in Panama and unloaded about 2 a.m., officials at the
Delaware base said.
   The two were identified as Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Andrew
P. Porter, 25, of St. Clair, Mich., and Army Pfc. James A. Tabor
Jr., 18, of Montrose, Colo. Porter was based at Fort Ord, Calif.,
and Tabor was based at Fort Bragg, N.C.
   The body of another serviceman flown to Dover early Saturday was
identified as 1st Lt. John R. Hunter, 30, of Victor, Mont. Hunter
was based at Fort Campbell, Ky. and was an Army helicopter crewman.
   The remains of those killed are being brought to Dover Air Force
Base to be prepared for burial before being transferred to their
next of kin. The base houses the Defense Department's largest
mortuary.
