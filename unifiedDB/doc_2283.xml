   Moderate earthquakes struck in Southern California and in
Hawaii, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries
in either temblor.
   The California quake rattled residents along a 100-mile stretch
from Palm Springs to Los Angeles today, officials said.
   The quake, centered about seven miles northwest of San
Bernardino, hit at 1:41 a.m. and measured 4.3 on the Richter scale,
said Hall Daily, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena.
   ``It shook us pretty good,'' said Jay Diamond, a disc jockey for
KFRG-FM. ``The glass on the booth was shaking.''
   In Hawaii, a quake that registered 4.6 on the Richter Scale
shook Hawaii Island's Puna district at 11:13 p.m. Wednesday, said
William Mass, a geophysist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center on
the island of Oahu.
   It didn't cause a tsunami, or tidal wave, Mass said.
   Police checked the area around the epicenter for signs of
damage, but found none, said Officer Randy Arello.
   ``It was strong enough to feel, but not that bad,'' Arello said.
   Quakes ranging in magnitude from 4 to 5 on the Richter scale of
ground motion are considered moderate, and can cause some local
damage, mostly broken houseware, items falling from shelves, broken
windows and cracks in poorly built structures.
