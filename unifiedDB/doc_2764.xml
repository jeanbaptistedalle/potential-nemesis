   Members of a pro-Iranian terrorist
group arrested in Spain were planning to use surface-to-air
missiles to attack Arab and French civilian airliners, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   The daily Asharq Al-Awsat, in a dispatch from Madrid, quoted
unidentified Spanish officials who questioned the suspected
terrorists, believed linked to the pro-Iranian group Hezbollah.
   Spanish police refused to comment on a similar report that
appeared Dec. 28 in the Madrid daily Diario.
   Last month, police discovered a large cache of explosives the
suspects allegedly were trying to smuggle into Spain.
   ``The investigations revealed that Hezbollah planned to use
surface-to-air missiles to hit NATO interests in France, as well as
passenger planes of Arab and French civil aviation airlines,'' the
Saudi Arabian newspaper report said.
   The time frame of the attacks was not clear, but the Saudi paper
said the group planned ``a series of acts of terrorism'' in France
in January.
   The report came at the same time as a bomb threat against a
Northwest Airlines flight Saturday from Paris to Detroit. An
anonymous telephone caller said the flight was targeted in
retaliation for life sentences given to two Palestinians who were
convicted in Sweden this month in a series of bombings.
   One of the Palestinians was Mohammed Abu Talb, a suspect in last
year's bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland.
