   A woman faked a kidnapping of her two children in
a scheme to get $12,000 ``ransom'' from her husband and then leave
him, police said.
   Arazelia Delgadillo, 27, was freed Monday on $200 bail on
charges of falsifying a police report, which carries up to six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Ms. Delgadillo on Saturday told police her 2-year-old and
4-year-old boys had been taken along with her car while she was
inside a grocery store.
   Police, following instructions from Ms. Delgadillo, set up a
ransom drop Sunday, but the ``kidnappers'' never showed,
authorities said.
   Later Sunday, FBI agents traced a phone call made to the woman's
home and found the children at an apartment where Ms. Delgadillo's
14-year-old brother was living, police said.
   ``She thought her husband would just go to the bank, get
$12,000, and she would take it and leave,'' Sgt. Mark Langford said.
   No charges were filed against the woman's brother.
