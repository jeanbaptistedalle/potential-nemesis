<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Pentagon Considering Big Troop Cuts In Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Defense planners are suggesting a possible
two-thirds reduction in U.S. Army forces in South Korea as part of
proposed drastic cuts in U.S. troop strength in the Pacific, The
Washington Post reported today.
   The options for troop cuts were presented to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, in a meeting Monday at the Pentagon, the Post reported,
citing unidentified sources.
   No decisions have been made on the proposals, the newspaper said.
   Maj. David Super, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said he knew
nothing about the meeting reported by the newspaper.
   Overall in the Pacific, the maximum amount of cuts contemplated
in the Pentagon briefing paper given to Cheney would mean a
reduction of 80,000 people from the Army and Air Force by the end
of the 1994 fiscal year for a savings of $3.6 billion, the
newspaper reported.
   Currently the Army has 32,052 people stationed in South Korea
and options presented to Cheney would cut that to a 5,200-person
brigade and another 6,550 in support, the newspaper said.
