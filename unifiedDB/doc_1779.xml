   Charles Hunter surprised his teacher and
classmates with the results of a one-in-a-million task. But he had
a little high-tech help from a computer.
   Steve Randak, who teaches a biology class for gifted students at
Lafayette Jefferson High School, told his students he would give an
A for the semester to anyone who wrote out every number from one to
1 million.
   Hunter took up the challenge. Last week he toted in all 1
million numbers printed on about 2,400 pages of paper that weighed
about 50 pounds.
   He didn't qualify for the A because he generated the numbers on
his home computer, but his regular work is earning him an A in the
course anyway.
   ``He's the first one who ever took off and did something
creative with this, and this is typical of Charles,'' said Randak.
   Hunter said he first set out to write each number by hand, but
he lost interest at about 5,000.
   His interest was renewed when he thought of printing the numbers
by computer. He ran the program at least seven hours a day for two
weeks. After 2{ boxes of computer paper and three ink cartridges,
he reached the magic number.
   ``I just thought it would be really neat to show someone could
do it and to prove how large a million is,'' said Hunter.
   Doing the task longhand, even at the brisk pace of one number a
second, would take more than 11{ days straight, working night and
day.
