   A woman faces up to life in prison and a $10,000
fine after a jury convicted her of injuring her brain-damaged son
by blowing air through a feeding tube while the infant was
hospitalized.
   Brenda Garza, 23, of Lake Jackson, was secretly videotaped by
authorities at Texas Children's Hospital on June 8. Hospital
officials became concerned because the condition of Jesus Garza III
improved when he was with nurses but deteriorated after his
mother's visits.
   On the tape, she was seen blowing air into a tube that had been
inserted into the child's stomach. She also appeared to hold her
fingers against the child's windpipe.
   She then complained to a nurse that her child's stomach was
swollen. When the nurse would leave, the woman would blow through
the tube again, prosecutor Jan Krocker said.
   Jurors who convicted her of the first-degree felony Thursday and
now must consider punishment. Ms. Garza's attorney, Felix Cantu,
said his client deserved a second chance and wants jurors to
consider probation.
