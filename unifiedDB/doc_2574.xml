   Comedian Billy Crystal will serve as the sole
host of the 1990 Academy Awards broadcast, the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences announced Friday.
   It will mark the third consecutive awards show appearance for
Crystal and his first as host. The single-host format returns after
1989's ill-fated multi-host show, which featured Rob Lowe and an
unauthorized Snow White impersonator.
   ``We are extremely pleased to have Billy host the show,''
Gilbert Cates, producer of the 1990 telecast, said in a statement.
``His unique talents and his ability to handle the unexpected will
be important assets this year.''
   Nominations for the 62nd Annual Academy Awards will be announced
on Feb. 14. Among the films in contention is the comedy ``When
Harry Met Sally...,'' in which Crystal co-stars. The Oscar trophies
will be presented at the Los Angeles Music Center on March 26.
