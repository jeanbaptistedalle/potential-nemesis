   The first stock exchange in
Communist Yugoslavia was set up Tuesday in the northern city of
Ljubljana, the state Tanjug news agency reported.
   It said the exchange was founded with a total capital of $17
million, and that 152 stocks representing more than 50 percent of
its capital were owned by 23 Yugoslav banks.
   The exchange will list Yugoslav and foreign companies and will
publish the so-called YUIX _ the Yugoslav Index _ of average
closing prices of selected stocks at the close of each trading day.
   A capital and securities market was established last month in
Belgrade in keeping with reformist Premier Ante Markovic's policy
of introducing Western market mechanisms into the Yugoslav economy.
   Last week Markovic announced that as of Jan. 1 the Yugoslav
dinar would become Eastern Europe's first convertible currency.
   Neighboring Hungary's stock exchange has been open partially for
about a year.
