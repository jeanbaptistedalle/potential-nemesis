<HEAD>Iran Selling Oil In Advance, Saving On Imports After Abadan Reopened</HEAD>

   Iran's advance sales of oil have yielded
$2.6 billion, and it has saved $800 million in imported petroleum
products since its Abadan refinery resumed operations in April, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   In an interview with the daily Kayhan, Oil Minister Gholamreza
Aqazadeh also reiterated his previous prediction that members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon be
able to produce as much oil as they want.
   Aqazadeh, in excerpts from the interview quoted by the Islamic
Republic News Agency, said the members of OPEC were nearing their
top production capacity and demand for oil would be strong enough
that quotas would become unnecessary.
   He said a decision was taken by Iran to sell oil in advance,
raising $2.6 billion, because of the ``favorable condition of the
market.''
   He said the contracts were to receive cash now and supply the
oil within 12 to 18 months, ``which truly cannot be considered
(extra) oil revenue, but rather a more flexible sales policy.''
   Aqazadeh said future Iranian oil-related revenues from 1989 to
1994 were estimated at about $83 billion, including crude oil, gas
exports to the Soviet Union, sales of liquefied gas and other
related products.
   Since the reopening in April of the huge Abadan refinery on the
Gulf coast near the Iran-Iraq border, Iran has saved $800 million
on imported refined products, Aqazadeh said.
   He also said the Arak refinery, with a capacity of 150,000
barrels a day, and the Bandar Abbas refinery, with a capacity of
230,000 barrels a day, would soon become operational.
