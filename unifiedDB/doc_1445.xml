   Stock prices in London were slightly higher at
midday Friday, but trading volume remained thin ahead of Christmas.
   Traders took heart from the market's upward move, which was
achieved despite a weak showing earlier in Tokyo.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 7.4 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,360.4, also
its morning high.
   Volume came to 264.6 million shares at midday, compared with 235
million shares at the same time Thursday.
