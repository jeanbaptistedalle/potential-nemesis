   A woman driving up to 80 mph the wrong
way on an interstate crashed head-on into another car, killing four
of its five family members and herself, authorities said.
   The woman, who was driving alone, apparently missed her exit,
made a U-turn on Interstate 5, and collided with the car carrying a
family from Tracy about 1 a.m. Christmas Day, California Highway
Patrol officers said.
   Killed were Dale Cooper, 34, his two sons, Michael, 15, and
Christopher, 10, and his mother, Nae Cosby. Cooper's wife, Diana,
35, was in critical but stable condition Tuesday at Doctors Medical
Center in Modesto, where she underwent surgery.
   Also killed was L'Tanya Clause, 26, of Modesto, who may have
been driving 80 mph before her car crashed into the Coopers',
officers said.
   Highway Patrol investigators said they had ruled out fog or
alcohol as contributing to the accident.
