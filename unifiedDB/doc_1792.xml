   A French Roman Catholic priest was
shot to death in southeastern Brazil, apparently while trying to
resist a holdup, police said Monday.
   Gabriel Mayra's body was found Saturday slumped over the wheel
of his car with a .32 caliber bullet in his heart, police radio
operator Edson Andrade said by telephone from Vitoria, 310 miles
northeast of Rio.
   Andrade said a bag containing the priest's cassock and his empty
wallet was found about 100 yards from the car.
   Mayra had been in Brazil nine years and worked in Vila Velha
parish eight miles south of Vitoria, he said.
   Andrade said Mayra had received death threats for his support of
an ousted mayor but ``was very well liked by the people here. The
crime had nothing to do with politics. It was a simple holdup.''
