   Upjohn Co. said Wednesday it would phase
out production of industrial chemicals at a North Haven, Conn.
plant and take a $200 million charge against fourth-quarter
earnings to reflect that and other restructuring steps.
   Upjohn would scale back production at the plant and planned to
sell its industrial chemical product lines and technologies next
year, Chairman Theodore Cooper said in a statement.
   ``The industrial chemical business no longer fits our corporate
strategy,'' Cooper said, adding that the North Haven plant had
become unprofitable because of a number of factors, including
obsolescence, competition and shrinking markets.
   Most of the 178 jobs at the plant would be phased out by the end
of 1992, some through normal attrition and early retirement
incentives, the company said.
   Upjohn said 65 percent of the $200 million charge was
attributable to the phaseout of the North Haven plant, while the
other 35 percent was due to a previously-announced special
retirement plan and other one-time expenses.
   Industrial chemicals include benzephonone, used in soaps and
perfumes, DCNA, used in dyes and as an agricultural fungicide, and
dichlorobenzidine, used in making yellow ink and dye pigments,
Upjohn spokesman J.P. Lambrechts said.
