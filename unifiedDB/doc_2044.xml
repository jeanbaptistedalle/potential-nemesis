   Anti-aircraft batteries opened fire
late Tuesday at two unidentified aircraft that flew low over the
capital, the government radio station Voice of Nicaragua reported.
   The radio broadcast said the control tower at the Augusto Cesar
Sandino International Airport unsuccessfully tried to establish
radio contact with the aircraft as they approached Managua from the
north and the east before the batteries opened fire at about 9:30
p.m.
   The aircraft escaped, but the incident panicked residents of
neighborhoods close to the airport as firing continued for several
minutes and anti-aircraft tracers blew across the sky.
   The Sandinista government has placed the army on ``maximum
alert'' since U.S. troops invaded Panama one week ago to oust Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry said it was continuing
efforts to arrange the evacuation of 156 Nicaraguan nationals from
Panama. Most of the Nicaraguans were businesspeople, the ministry
said.
   The government also sought to remove two aircraft operated by
the national airline Aeronica that have been trapped at Panama
City's Omar Torrijos airport since the invasion began.
