   A reporter from the newspaper Trud will
accompany Pope John Paul II on a papal trip to Africa next month,
the first time a Soviet journalist will travel on one of the
pontiff's visits.
   The Vatican on Friday released a list of 50 journalists who will
fly aboard a specially outfitted plane that will take the pope,
Vatican officials and many from the Vatican press corps on an
eight-day trip to Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Burkina Faso, Chad and Cape
Verde.
   On the list was Soviet journalist Pavel Nigoitsa, who is
accredited with the Vatican press office.
