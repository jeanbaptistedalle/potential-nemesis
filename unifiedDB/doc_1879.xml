   Here is a selection of quotations from the
writings of Samuel Beckett, the playwright who died Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Waiting for Godot'':
   We are all born mad. Some remain so.
   
   Estragon: Let's go.
   Vladimir: We can't.
   Estragon: Why not?
   Vladimir: We're waiting for Godot.
   
   Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Malone Dies'':
   Death must take me for someone else.
   
   To be buried in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows
what stuff he is made of. To know he can do better next time,
unrecognizably better, and that there is no next time, and that it
is a blessing there is not, there is a thought to be going on with.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``All that Fall'':
   This dust will not settle in our time. And when it does some
great roaring machine will come and whirl it all sky-high again.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Endgame'':
   Clov: Do you believe in the life to come?
   Hamm: Mine was always that.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Murphy'':
   There is no return game between a man and his stars.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From ``Stirrings Still,'' Beckett's last published work:
   A clock afar struck the hours and half-hours. The same as when
among others Darly once died and left him. Strokes now clear as if
carried by a wind now faint on the still air. Cries afar now faint
now clear. Head on hands half hoping when the hour struck that the
half-hour would not and half fearing that it would not. Similarly
when the half-hour struck. Similarly when the cries a moment
ceased. Or merely wondering. Or merely waiting. Waiting to hear.
