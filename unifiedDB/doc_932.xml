<HEAD>U.S. Invasion Upsets Noriega's Pen Pal</HEAD>

   The 12-year-old girl who corresponded
with Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega is standing by her deposed pen
pal.
   Sarah York said Wednesday she was upset with the U.S. invasion
of Panama and was worried about the safety of Noriega, who went
into hiding.
   ``I hope that he's doing OK and nothing bad will happen to
him,'' she said. ``He's very nice and intelligent and seems like
the kind of person someone can trust. He never let me down and I
feel like I can trust him. ...
   ``I'm really disappointed about what our two governments are
doing and I feel for the safety of Panamanian and United States
soldiers.''
   Sarah struck up a correspondence with Noriega following his 1988
indictment on U.S. drug charges. She has visited the dictator
twice, first as his guest last year, then in October on her own.
Noreiga called her a ``meritorious daughter'' of Panama.
   Her parents, criticized for allowing the visits, condemned the
invasion.
   ``We are a family among the American people who support the
Panamanians in their struggle for self-determination and
sovereignty,'' Pauline York said in a recorded telephone message at
her home.
   ``We join the people and the nations of the world in calling on
the president and his military to end this invasion. To the
Panamanian people: Todo por la patria,'' which means ``all for the
motherland,'' the recording said.
