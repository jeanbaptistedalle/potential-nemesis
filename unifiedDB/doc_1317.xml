   Jennifer Rachman thought a box of
bulging trash bags would be a good place to hide presents for her
family. Her husband thought the box should go out with the trash.
   The box, concealing luggage for her husband and a TV set for her
8-year-old son Jake, was gone for two hours Wednesday before Mrs.
Rachman found out. A frantic call went out to BZ Disposal.
   ``They were sorry, but they said there was absolutely no chance
I could find my box,'' Mrs. Rachman recalled. ``They said by then
it was buried under tons and tons of garbage. I called the dump,
and they said the same thing. Then I sat down and cried for two
hours.''
   But she underestimated the disposal company. Truck driver Genaro
Duran was curious about the box and set it aside. Later he found
the gifts and, figuring some thief had dumped loot, told a
supervisor, Manuel Sarinana.
   The supervisor took the box to the company office and there
someone remembered Mrs. Rachman's telephone call.
   ``It was,'' Mrs. Rachman said, ``my little miracle.''
