   Nearly 8,900 supplemental benefit checks
totalling $27.3 million were mailed last week to Vietnam War
veterans disabled by the chemical defoliant Agent Orange, the
lawyer administering the payment program said Monday.
   During the next several days 500 more checks will be sent to
veterans or their survivors, said the attorney, Deborah Greenspan.
The payments ranged from $256 to $8,100, she said.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn, who is
overseeing the Agent Orange benefit program, last month ordered
that the additional payments be sent before Christmas.
   The payments won't significantly change the total award an
eligible veteran will receive, but will provide a large share of
the compensation in a lump-sum payment.
   Veterans receiving the supplemental checks will continue to
receive annual benefit payments until 1994, but the amount of the
yearly payments will be reduced somewhat to account for the
lump-sum payment.
   Weinstein created the Agent Orange Settlement Fund in 1984 when
seven chemical companies _ without admitting guilt _ agreed to pay
$180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by Vietnam
veterans and their families who alleged injuries because of
exposure to the chemical during the war.
   Agent Orange, widely used by American forces during the Vietnam
War, contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin. In their lawsuit,
veterans said exposure to the defoliant caused cancer and other
illnesses, as well as birth defects in their children.
