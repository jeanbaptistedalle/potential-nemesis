   Michael Gross has found life after ``Family
Ties,'' although he was prepared to accept the relative obscurity
that can follow the end of a hit TV series.
   ``I really did wonder for a while if I was going to disappear
after the show went off the air,'' the actor said in a recent
interview. ``But then I realized that there are two definitions of
success: One is to be on a popular hit where everybody gets to see
what you do, and the second is to just do good work, regardless of
the size of the audience.''
   Gross, who portrayed the father of Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton
in ``Family Ties,'' plays King Arthur in this week's NBC movie ``A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'' He also has a role as
a survivalist in a science fiction film, ``Tremors,'' scheduled for
release next month.
