   Stock prices tumbled today in selling attributed
to spreading worries about the real-estate outlook.
   Brokers said traders remained uneasy about the outlook for
real-estate finance and regional banks after the Bank of New
England on Friday announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets.
   In the past couple of weeks, Wall Street has been devoting
increased attention to the soft real estate market in many parts of
the country, and the problems real-estate debt might pose should
prices of properties lag for an extended period.
   Some observers contend that the situation could become a primary
contributing factor to a debt-induced business slump in 1990.
   Also, analysts said, traders began dumping stocks on fears that
a yearend rally they had been anticipating might not materialize.
