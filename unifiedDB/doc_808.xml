   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, awaiting trial
on charges he helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in the alleged
plunder of the Philippine government, was granted permission
Wednesday to take a vacation to Colorado and Florida.
   Khashoggi has been free on $10 million bail since he was
extradited to this country from Switzerland in July. Conditions on
his bail include that he remain in New York and that his movements
be monitored by an electronic bracelet.
   Khashoggi, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, has been
living in a luxurious Fifth Avenue penthouse. His trial with Mrs.
Marcos is scheduled to begin March 14.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan granted his request for the
three-week vacation to visit family after Khashoggi's lawyer,
Robert Morvillo, said in a letter that federal prosecutors had
consented to it.
   According to his itinerary, Khashoggi will spend Dec. 27 to Jan.
3 at the home of his son, Mohammed, in Aspen, Colo. He then will
travel to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he will stay at the Mariott
Harbour Beach Resort.
   Morvillo said his letter that Khashoggi would visit with his
sister, who lives in Florida.
