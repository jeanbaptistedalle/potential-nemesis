<UNK>`Cold Comfort Farm' Novelist Dies</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel
``Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at the age of 87.
   Miss Gibbons, who suffered from a heart condition, died at her
home in north London.
   She wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and
poems but none rivaled her celebrated story, which parodied an
earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the
century.
   ``Cold Comfort Farm,'' published in 1932, tells how the
sophisticated Flora Poste visits her rural relatives, the weird
Starkadder family, and reclaims them from gloom, doom and feuding.
   In guidebook manner, the novelist inserted asterisks to mark
passages characteristic of the authors she parodied, such as Sheila
Kaye-Smith, Mary Webb and D.H. Lawrence.
   Miss Gibbons' 1933 poem, ``The Marriage of Machines,''
prophesied world pollution and destruction of wildlife.
   She was a journalist before she turned to books and was twice
married. Her second husband was actor and singer Allan Webb, who
died in 1959.
   He had been reclusive for the past 30 years, said her
son-in-law, John Richardson. ``She hated all publicity and politics
and really disliked modern life,'' he said.
