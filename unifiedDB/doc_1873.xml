   Residents of this U.S. territory were advised
to stock up on emergency supplies as a powerful typhoon stalled 200
miles to the east.
   Typhoon Jack, unusually late in the season for a major storm,
had sustained winds of 125 mph with gusts to 155 mph at 1 a.m.
Wednesday and was gradually weakening, according to the Joint
Typhoon Warning Center.
   Forecasters said the typhoon was expected to drift slowly toward
the northwest during the next 18 to 24 hours on a course that would
take it 57 miles north of Saipan.
   Before it stalled in the western Pacific, the storm had been on
a track that would take it between Guam and Saipan, the capital of
the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands north of Guam.
   ``The potential for erratic movement is high,'' said hourly
advisories issued by the center.
   The Air Force sent B-52 bombers to Okinawa and the Navy ordered
its large ships to sea to ride out the storm, officials said.
   Banks closed today and the 125,000 residents of Guam and the
30,000 people on Saipan were advised to get supplies of food,
water, batteries and the like.
   Guam is under a Tropical Cyclone Condition 2, meaning a storm
could hit the island within 24 hours.
