   A woman who says she was forced to go outside
her office to speak Spanish has filed a discrimination suit,
charging her former employer's English-only policy insulted
Hispanic employees.
   Ivette Gonzalez, a former probation counselor at the Salvation
Army, contended she was forced to resign in 1986 for failure to
abide by a ban on speaking of Spanish during breaks.
   ``They said the only way I could speak Spanish during lunch was
to go outside the building,'' said Mrs. Gonzalez, 34, a native of
Puerto Rico. ``I felt humiliated.''
   Ms. Gonzalez said the policy caused heart palpitations and
emotional distress. She is seeking more than $10,000 in damages and
reinstatement or reimbursement for lost wages in the suit filed
Monday in federal court.
   Her bilingual ability helped her get the job in 1986 with the
Salvation Army, which supervises people on probation for
misdemeanors.
   Two months later, center director Carroll Hepperle ordered
employees to stop speaking Spanish except when conversing with a
Spanish-speaking client, she said.
   Hepperle said English-only rule was issued because some
employees heard nothing but Spanish and felt they were being talked
about. Also, he had been told that some distasteful conversations
were overheard by Spanish-speaking employees, he said.
   ``We're not here to discriminate against people. We're here to
help people,'' he said.
