<HEAD>Consumer Commission Warns of Danger in Stuffed Animal</HEAD>

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said
today that a stuffed animal Christmas toy sold to nearly 2 million
people may present a hidden suffocation danger to young children.
   The warning involves the ``Velveteen Rabbit'' in a red Christmas
stocking sold from Target Stores in 23 states.
   ``There is a plastic bag around the lower portion of the rabbit
which may present a risk of suffocation to young children,'' the
agency said in a written statement.
   Consumers should remove and discard the bag immediately, the
commission said.
   The bag, which is not a part of the toy, is inside the stocking
and ``may not be immediately noticed before the toy is given to a
child,'' the commission said.
   The floppy-eared brown-and-white rabbits come in two sizes _
8-inch and 12-inch _ and the bag on the larger rabbit could easily
fit over the head of a small child, a commission staffer said.
   Approximately 1,750,000 of the toys, which meet all mandatory
and voluntary packaging and toy safety standards, have been sold.
   The toy rabbits were sold in Missouri, Minnesota, Illinois,
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, Nevada, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Washington,
California, Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, Florida and
North Carolina.
   Consumers may contact Target Stores at 612-370-6000.
