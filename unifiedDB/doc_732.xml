   A new church chime that rings and plays
hymns during the day frightens dogs and birds and wakes small
children from their naps, says a neighborhood group that wants the
electronic bells silenced.
   ``It's like having a grandfather clock with monster speakers put
in the middle of your home without your permission,'' said Vaughan
Pritchett, who lives two doors away.
   Pritchett said Monday the three couples who sued tried to
negotiate with Bellshire United Methodist Church for two months but
could not reach a compromise. He said he regrets the holiday timing
of the suit, but he wants the Christmas hymns and other melodies
toned down.
   The carillon was installed in September with $7,700 donated by a
former church member in memory of her son, said the Rev. Stephen
Smith, pastor at Bellshire.
   The bells are played from four speakers each day until early
evening. They strike the hour six times a day and play hymns three
times.
   ``We have half a dozen people who live as close to the church as
these people do, who love the carillon,'' he said.
   ``We could raise the volume a lot higher, but we're respecting
the neighbors,'' Smith said. ``We did respect the neighbor who goes
to bed early, and we quit striking the hour at 7 p.m.''
   A letter filed with the lawsuit from Walter H. Collins, a public
health environmentalist, said a test in September showed the bells
were louder than a typical freight train heard from a distance of
100 feet.
   A court hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3.
