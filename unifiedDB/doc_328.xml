   One of the surprising things Don and Susan Waite learned in
planning their wedding is that a celebration at a public place _ a
restaurant, catering hall or country club _ can be less expensive
than one at home.
   Most catering halls are equipped with everything needed to
entertain a crowd. So they can offer a package price lower than an
event at a private site, where many items must be rented
individually. The one-stop wedding party also may take less time to
plan.
   The Waites decided against going this route because they wanted
to keep control of all the details. They especially liked the idea
that their wedding in all its aspects would be a personal
reflection of them. And they could keep the party going as long as
they wanted. They discovered that most public places have more than
one wedding in a day, so they would have been limited to a booking
schedule.
   The Waites spent about $20,000 on their wedding and the party,
not including the cost of clothing. Susan's dress cost about $800,
while Don and his attendants rented their attire.
   Costs worked out as follows: $3,000 to rent and erect two large
heated tents, $2,000 for photography, $2,000 for the band, and
$12,000 for the catering services, food and beverages.
   A tip the Waites offer others who are planning a wedding is to
decide on the guest list early and to order extra invitations.
   ``We thought we had 100 friends and relatives to invite. So we
ordered 100 invitations. Then we thought of 100 more we had to
have. We had to order extra invitations, which was quite
expensive,'' recalls Susan.
