   Fourteen bodies were found in the
central hill district a day after pro-government vigilantes killed
at least 170 suspected militants in another part of the country,
military officials said Friday.
   Elsewhere, eight other people were killed Friday in the ethnic
violence, officials said.
   The officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
said the latest bodies were found in the Kandy district Thursday
night and early Friday, and were believed to be Sinhalese radicals
killed by vigilantes. They said the victims had been shot and the
bodies burned to prevent identification.
   On Thursday, officials said 170 radicals had been killed in the
southern Hambantota district since Wednesday night.
   In other areas of the country, at least four radicals were
killed by police and three civilians and a soldier were killed by
the militants, the officials said.
   At least 6,000 people have been killed since Sinhalese radicals
began trying to overthrow the government in July 1987. The radicals
say the government made too many concessions in a peace agreement
designed to end a civil war started by Tamil separatists in 1983
that has taken about 8,000 lives.
   Three-quarters of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are ethnic
Sinhalese. Tamils make up 18 percent of the population and claim
discrimination by the Sinhalese, who control the government and
military.
