<HEAD>U.S. Cigarette Use Down; Exports at Record Level</HEAD>

   Americans smoked less in 1989 than in the year
before, the Agriculture Department said Monday.
   ``Despite record exports of about 130 billion cigarettes, output
is down,'' said the report from the department's Economic Research
Service.
   U.S. cigarette consumption may be off about 4 percent from last
year, the report said, without detail. ``Use of cigars and smoking
tobacco continues to decline, but snuff production is up,'' it
added.
   The Agriculture Department said the U.S. tobacco crop is larger
this year than last, but overall 1989-90 supplies are lower because
of smaller stocks held at the beginning of the year.
   ``Tighter supplies, higher price supports, and a little better
quality 1989 crop have boosted prices of most types of tobacco this
season,'' said the report.
   Flue-cured tobacco averaged $1.67 a pound, 6 cents more than
last year.
   Burley sales began Nov. 20, with prices averaging about 5 cents
a pound higher than a year earlier.
   Total production this year is expected to be nearly 1.5 billion
pounds, 7 percent above 1988, but 16 percent below the 1980-85
average.
