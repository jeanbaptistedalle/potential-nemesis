   An 83-year-old man who often argued
heatedly with his stepdaughter shot her and his wife dead on
Christmas Day, then killed himself, police said Tuesday.
   Donnie Carlisle shot his wife, Virginia, 80, in the head, and
his stepdaughter, Carolyn Dempsey, 53, in the head and chest about
7 p.m. Monday, Lt. Michael A. Butler said. He then left the house
and went to the nearby home of his daughter, Butler said.
   ``I just shot Virginia, I just shot Carolyn, and now I'm going
to shoot myself,'' Mary Davis said her father told her.
   Ms. Davis said she tried to stop her father, but he knocked her
down, went back to his house and shot himself in the head and
chest, Butler said. Carlisle died about two hours later at Self
Memorial Hospital, he said.
   Officers found a .22-caliber rifle in the Carlisles' living room
that apparently was used in the shootings.
   Ms. Davis told investigators her father threatened to kill the
women and himself on Saturday after arguing with Ms. Dempsey. Ms.
Davis said she talked her father out of it.
   ``He stayed at her house about half the day just talking about
how he was being treated,'' the police report said.
   Ms. Davis told investigators ``there were always very heated
arguments'' between her father and Ms. Dempsey. Police did not say
what those arguments were about.
