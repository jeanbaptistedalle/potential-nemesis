<HEAD>Toyota Reportedly Expects Record Domestic Sales in 1990</HEAD>

   Toyota Motor Corp. expects its 1990 domestic sales
to grow 8 percent from this year while exports remain stable,
President Shoichiro Toyoda was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Surging domestic demand will boost domestic sales for a seventh
consecutive year, to a record 2.48 million vehicles next year
compared with this year's estimated sales of 2.30 million, Kyodo
News Service quoted Toyoda as saying.
   The predictions of Japan's largest automaker come in the face of
recent loss of market share due to the brisk performance of Nissan
Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, which has been cutting into
Toyota's dominance in the domestic market, Kyodo noted.
   While Toyota's 8 percent domestic sales growth outpaces Nissan's
estimate of 4 percent growth in domestic sales to 1.37 million
vehicles next year, Nissan officials announced Tuesday they expect
overseas production to grow a hefty 7 percent in 1990 to 683,000.
   Toyota's exports are expected to remain flat at 1.68 million
units next year, Toyoda said.
   Toyota, which accounts for 41.8 percent of total domestic sales,
plans to boost its share to around 42.8 percent, he said.
