the decline that began late last week.

   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 3 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 359 up,
1,148 down and 436 unchanged.
   Brokers said traders remained uneasy about the outlook for
real-estate finance and regional bank stocks after the Bank of New
England on Friday announced projected increases in its loan-loss
reserve and non-performing assets.
   In the past couple of weeks, Wall Street has been devoting
increased concern to the soft real estate market in many parts of
the country and the problems real-estate debt might pose should
prices of properties lag for an extended period.
   Bank of New England shares led the active list, down 1[ at 7~ on
the heels of a 3]-point drop Friday.
   Among other mortgage and regional banking issues, Citytrust
Bancorp fell 1} to 15]; Federal National Mortgage 2{ to 31\, and
Federal Home Loan Mortgage 4\ to 63{.
   Losers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, down 1] at 93|; American Express, down ~ at 32],
and McDonald's, down \ at 34.
   Otherwise, analysts said hopes persisted that stocks could
overcome their recent hesitancy and gain ground in the next few
weeks, aided by the lifting of pressures from yearend tax selling.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.21 to 191.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was off 3.34 at 372.16.
