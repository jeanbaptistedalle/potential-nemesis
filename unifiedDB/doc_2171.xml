   Typhoon Jack weakened rapidly Thursday to
tropical depression status and no longer posed a threat to this
U.S. territory or any other islands in the western Pacific, weather
officials said.
   Jack's sustained winds, which had been clocked as high as 135
mph Tuesday, fell to 30 mph by 11 a.m. Thursday, according to the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   In eight hours on Thursday, Jack went from typhoon status, with
winds of at least 74 mph, to a tropical storm, with winds from 39
to 73 mph, to a tropical depression, with winds less than 39 mph,
the center said.
   At last report, Jack was 220 miles southeast of Guam and slowly
drifting south and unlikely to re-form into a threatening storm,
forecasters said.
