   A huge avalanche struck southwestern
Switzerland and killed six Swiss skiers, rescue officials said
Saturday.
   The avalanche was 1,000 feet wide and hit the Mt. Simplon region
Friday. The victims were five youths and a guide who were on a
two-day tour in the region. Searchers in a helicopter found their
bodies.
   Officials said two of the youths apparently had been able to
free themselves from the masses of snow but then died of exposure
and exhaustion.
