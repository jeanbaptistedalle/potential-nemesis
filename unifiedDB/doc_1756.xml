   Four men believed to be agents of
ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's hated security police agents
were arrested Monday in Yugoslavia, Belgrade radio reported.
   The four were part of a group of Romanian defectors who crossed
the Danube into Yugoslavia overnight at Kladovo, about 100 miles
east of Belgrade.
   ``It can be assumed with great certainty that they are members
of the Securitate'' _ the secret police, the broadcast said.
   Several other Romanians agents are believed to be hiding in the
hills around Kladovo, the radio said without elaborating.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the incident by police.
