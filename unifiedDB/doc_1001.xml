   The European Community said Thursday it
would send medical aid to Poland as part of an ongoing medical aid
program in place since 1982.
   The 1989 package worth $2.9 million will buy medication and
small medical supplies. The aid brings total EC medical aid to
Poland since 1982 to $60.8 million.
   The medical supplies will be distributed by the Red Cross and a
West German medical charity who have been distributing the EC's
medical aid to Poland since 1982.
