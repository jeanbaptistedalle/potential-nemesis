   Leaking butane gas exploded Saturday at an
Amoco Oil Co. refinery, killing one worker and injuring another, a
company spokesman said.
   Amoco and Casper firefighters took three hours to put out the
blaze, which began with a flash of fire around 6:30 a.m.
   Rick Nemitz, 33, was killed when the gas ignited as he was
shutting down an outdoor refinery unit, and was either blown to the
ground or fell from an upper deck, according to spokesman D. Allen
Miller.
   Kurt Sides, 31, who had been working on the ground, suffered
second- and third-degree burns to his face and left hand, Miller
said. Sides was in stable condition at Wyoming Medical Center.
   ``We don't have any idea what ignited the butane,'' Miller said.
``At this point we don't even know the extent of the damage.''
   No one else was in the area at the time of the blast, Miller
said. The unit, which combines butane and other gases to produce
high-octane gasoline, will be shut down until investigators can
determine the cause of the blaze.
   The leak occurred at the connection point of two pipes, Miller
said.
   Miller said there must have been a very high concentration of
butane before the blast because such gas leaks usually dissipate
into the air. He said he didn't know what ignited the gas.
   Amoco officials and the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration were investigating the accident, the spokesman said.
   Amoco Oil is a subsidiary of Amoco Corp.
