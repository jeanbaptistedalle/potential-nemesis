   The wife of Ukrainian dissident Mikhailo Horyn
was being treated in the United States on Monday after 105 members
of Congress asked Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to give her a
temporary exit visa.
   Olha Horyn, who arrived in the United States on Saturday, had
applied for a temporary visa seven months ago. She did not
immediately get it despite a new Soviet law that guarantees a
decision on medical visa requests within three days, said Rep.
Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y.
   Slaughter sent the letter, signed by 104 colleagues, Nov. 8.
   Mrs. Horyn had applied for a visa after receiving an offer of
free medical treatment from St. Barnabas Medical Center in
Livingston, N.J. The care she will receive there over the next
three months is not available in the Soviet Union, said Bozhena
Olshaniwsky, president of Americans for Human Rights in the Ukraine.
   Mrs. Horyn had a radical mastectomy 10 years ago, but is
suffering back pain that may indicate the cancer has returned,
Olshaniwsky said.
   Olshaniwsky said she believed Mrs. Horyn's visa was blocked
because of her and her husband's political activity.
   Mikhailo Horyn, a former political prisoner, is general
secretary of the Ukrainian national movement, Rukh, and the brother
of dissident leader Bogdan Horyn. Mikhailo Horyn is a candidate for
a seat in the Ukrainian parliament.
