   The stock market was mixed today, marking time
in the next-to-last session of the year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.77 to 2,721.63
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 559 up, 397 down and
538 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 17.56 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Much of the activity appeared to be devoted to last-minute
maneuvering by investors for tax and yearend portfolio reporting
purposes.
   Analysts said money managers at many investing institutions had
pretty well closed their books on 1989, and thus were making few
waves in the marketplace.
   The government is due to report Friday on the index of leading
economic indicators for November.
   Advance estimates call for a flat to slightly higher showing by
the index, which would presumably do little to resolve the
questions in investors' minds about the economic outlook for the
first half of 1990.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose { to 45[; International Business Machines was steady at 94};
Philip Morris lost [ to 40[, and Exxon was down [ at 50].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .17 to 192.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .14 at 373.10.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.14 to
2,724.40.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 931 up, 549 down and 476 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 133.73 million shares, up from 77.61
million in the previous session.
