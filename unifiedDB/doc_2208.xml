<HEAD>Securities Firm Sells Foreign-Currency Operations to Japanese Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cooper Neff &amp; Associates said it intends to
sell its foreign-currency operations to a Japanese trust bank for
an undisclosed sum.
   Cooper Neff, a securities trader on the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, said Tuesday the deal with Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking Co.
Ltd. could be completed by late spring. Federal regulators would
have to approve the sale.
   Cooper Neff, founded in 1980, accounts for 15 percent of all
foreign-currency futures and options traded at the Philadelphia
Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Mitsui Trust would continue trading both products in
Philadelphia and Chicago through MTB Options Inc., which would be
created for that purpose.
   About 30 of Cooper Neff's 100 employees would shift to Mitsui
Trust but remain in Philadelphia, managing partner Richard W.
Cooper said.
   Mitsui Trust is the oldest of Japan's seven trust banks and has
$174 billion in assets, making it one of the world's largest
financial institutions.
