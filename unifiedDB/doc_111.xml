   Doctors were trying to learn why a 2-year-old
boy died after twice receiving split livers in transplants.
   Mitchell Wallace of Hannibal, N.Y., died Saturday of multiple
systems failure, said Margie Buczynski, a spokeswoman for
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. She said doctors planned to
perform tests to determine what caused the failure.
   A lack of available donor organs led doctors to try the
split-liver transplants, which are possible because the organs
regenerate themselves.
   Mitchell received his first split liver Nov. 29, but the liver
did not function properly, doctors said.
   On Wednesday, doctors split one liver to transplant into
Mitchell and a 3-year-old child, whom the hospital did not identify
at the parents' request.
   The 3-year-old was in serious condition late Saturday, Ms.
Buczynski said. Hospital officials would not release the child's
condition Sunday.
   Before the operations, Mitchell had suffered from liver failure
of unknown origin. He was found to have hepatitis after his own
liver was removed.
