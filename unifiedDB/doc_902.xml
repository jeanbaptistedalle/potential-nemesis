   Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading
Wednesday, as the market reacted with enthusiasm to Wall Street's
recovery from its Tuesday lows.
   Selective buying, the re-emergence of takeover speculation in
the composite insurance sector, and the continuation of a stock
shortage also helped the market, dealers said.
   Still, the market was lethargic despite good volume, dealers
said.
   ``People are conscious of the strengths of the market, but many
are still happy to sit on the sidelines,'' said one dealer, adding
that business was winding down ahead of the approaching holidays.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 18.6
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,360.7.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 13.5 points at 1,866.0
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.53 points
to close at 1,280.69.
   Volume amounted to a healthy 552.9 million shares compared with
589.2 million shares Tuesday.
