   World economic growth will continue next year _
but barely, a business research group reported.
   The Conference Board's international economic scoreboard,
released Wednesday, shows the composite leading index for 11 major
industrial countries inching up at an annual rate of 1 percent,
down from 4 percent six months ago and 5 percent a year ago. The
leading index is designed to foretell economic activity.
   ``Throughout the industrial world, the outlook for economic
expansion is not very exciting,'' said Edgar R. Fiedler, vice
president and economic counselor for the group.
   ``Although neither a recession nor an inflationary boom is
impossible in the months ahead, neither seems probable,'' Fiedler
said.
   One of the few countries with any vigor is Taiwan. Its leading
economic index is rising at an 8 percent yearly pace, the same as
three months ago and up slightly from the 7 percent pace posted six
months ago.
   But Taiwan's economy apparently has cooled from a year ago when
its leading index was rising at a 15 percent rate.
   Here are the annual rates of change in the latest leading
indexes for the other 10 countries included in the Conference
Board's international economic scoreboard, compared with the rates
released a year ago:
   United States, 1 percent vs. 3 percent
   Canada, 3 percent vs. 1 percent
   West Germany, 5 percent vs. 4 percent
   France, 0 vs. 9 percent
   United Kingdom, -1 percent vs. 2 percent
   Italy, 0 vs. 2 percent
   Japan, 1 percent vs. 8 percent
   Australia, -2 percent vs. 3 percent
   South Korea, 2 percent vs. 9 percent
   New Zealand, 4 percent vs. -1 percent.
