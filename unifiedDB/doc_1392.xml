   Archbishop Desmond Tutu arrived on a Christmas
pilgrimage Friday after stirring anger in Israel by comparing its
treatment of Palestinians with South Africa's oppression of blacks.
   The black Anglican archbishop of South Africa, who won the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize, told reporters at Ben-Gurion airport: ``It is a
great honor and experience to celebrate Christmas in the Holy
Land.''
   In a five-day visit, Tutus plans to visit Bethlehem in the
occupied West Bank on Christmas Eve and preach in Jerusalem on
Christmas Day.
   At the airport, Tutu was greeted by the head of the Anglican
church in Israel, Bishop Samir Kafity, and two low-level Israeli
officials.
   The Israeli daily Haaretz published a telephone interview
Thursday in which Tutu was quoted as saying: ``The description of
what is happening in the (occupied) Gaza Strip and West Bank could
be describing what is happening in South Africa.''
   Israeli officials have been concerned that Tutu might make
statements during the visit that would put Israel in a bad light.
