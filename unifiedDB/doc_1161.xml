   A reorganization plan for Yugo America Inc.,
the importer of small Yugoslavian-made automobiles, has been
approved by a federal bankruptcy judge.
   Under the plan approved Wednesday by Judge Vincent J. Commisa,
Yugo America will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Yugoslav
automaker Zastava.
   ``The direct ownership by Zastava of Yugo America Inc. is
expected to provide the U.S. sales arm with the financial strength
and marketing commitment required to firmly establish the Yugo in
the American market,'' Yugo America President John Spiech said.
   The unsecured creditors, which are owed an estimated $24
million, will receive 9 cents on the dollar, said Robert Baine,
attorney for Impex Car Corp., a U.S. agent for Zastava.
   The Yugo dealers will be paid back the entire $7 million owed
them, Baine said. Yugo's chief bank lender, Manufacturer's Hanover
Trust in New York, will receive all $1.6 million it is owed.
   Baine said that YugoBank, one of Yugoslavia's national banks,
has committed up to $24 million in credit to the company.
   Yugo America, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
laws on Jan. 30 along with its then-parent company Global Motors
Inc. and sister company Proton America.
   While the case was pending in bankruptcy court, Yugo continued
to sell cars.
   Yugo cars first went on sale in August 1985 for $3,995. Sales
during the first 10 months of this year were 9,193, down 78.1
percent from the same period in 1987, when sales were at their
highest rate.
   The reorganization, Spiech said, clears the way for the company
to offer a convertible and a new model line.
