<HEAD>Nevada Governor Rejects Federal Nuclear Dump Permit Requests</HEAD>

   Gov. Bob Miller has set the stage for a
court battle with the federal government by rejecting four permits
to study a Nevada site's suitability as the nation's first
high-level radioactive waste dump.
   ``This issue will certainly go to court,'' Miller said Tuesday
after rejecting the permit requests by the federal Energy
Department. ``The Legislature has passed and I have signed bills
that make the dump illegal here.
   ``We cannot issue permits allowing the DOE to begin testing a
site we have outlawed. They can't proceed without these permits.''
   Carl Gertz, the Energy Department's project manager for the
proposed Yucca Mountain site 110 miles northwest of Las Vegas,
agreed that Miller's action made a court battle inevitible.
   He said a lawsuit would be filed early next year to obtain the
permits.
   ``It seems strange to us that state officials say Yucca Mountain
is not suitable for the repository, yet the state will not grant us
the permits needed to make that determination scientifically,'' he
said.
   Current plans call for a waste site to be established by the
year 2010 to store 70,000 metric tons of radioactive wastes for
10,000 years. Yucca Mountain is the only location in the country
under consideration.
   Miller said the Energy Department has no authority to conduct
experiments at Yucca Mountain without the state's approval. That
was blocked earlier this year when the Legislature passed a bill
forbidding the storage of high-level nuclear waste in Nevada.
   Energy Department officials maintain the state cannot ban the
repository until the president recommends a site to Congress.
