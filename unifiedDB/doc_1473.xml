   Stock prices rose in quiet preholiday trading
today, aided what analysts described as yearend ``bargain hunting.''
   Traders appeared to be doing some last-minute shopping among
recently depressed stocks, hoping that the market will gather
strength after the pressure of tax selling is lifted with the
arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
