   A former cook at a restaurant owned by
Chuck Berry has filed a lawsuit accusing the rock 'n' roll legend
of secretly videotaping women using the restroom.
   Hosana A. Huck, who worked at the Southern Air in Wentzville,
about 30 miles from St. Louis, said that she and other employees
and customers were taped and that it humiliated her and caused her
emotional distress.
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in state court seeks unspecified
damages.
   Berry, 63, who lives near Wentzville, was unavailable for
comment. Calls to his restaurant went unanswered Wednesday.
   The suit alleges that the videotapes ``were created for the
improper purpose of the entertainment and gratification'' of
Berry's ``sexual fetishes and sexual predilections.''
   The duck-walking guitarist is known for such hits as ``Roll Over
Beethoven'' and ``Johnny B. Goode.''
