   The number of working domestic oil and gas rigs
dropped by 18 to total 1,061 after rising by 21 last week,
officials of Baker Hughes Inc. reported Tuesday.
   The company said the latest rig count is up from the 940 posted
a year ago.
   Baker Hughes' rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rotary rigs actively
exploring for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of
producing wells.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500.
   But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per 42-gallon barrel in
the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the rig count that
bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling
figures.
   Among the major oil producing states, California showed the
largest gain with seven, while Michigan posted six more rigs and
Colorado and Louisiana each added two.
   Of those showing losses for the week, Texas and Kansas each
dropped 13 rigs, Ohio had four, and New Mexico and Pennsylvania
lost three each.
   Both North Dakota and Wyoming had no change for the week.
