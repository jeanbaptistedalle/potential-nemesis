   Herman Short, a former Houston police chief who
gained a national reputation as a law-and-order hard-liner, has
died after suffering a lengthy heart ailment. He was 71.
   Short, who served as chief from 1964 to 1973, evoked the ire of
civil rights leaders in the late 1960s for his handling of racial
disturbances, but supporters said his tough stance in the face of
rioting prevented Houston from faring far worse.
   He once was mentioned as a potential running mate for 1968
conservative presidential candidate George Wallace.
   Short resigned on the eve of the inauguration of former Mayor
Fred Hofheinz, who planned to fire the chief the moment he took
office.
   ``We were essentially an all-white police department under
Herman that believed in heavy-handed tactics'' that included the
use of illegal wiretaps, Hofheinz said Thursday.
   Wiretapping indictments were returned against officers who had
served under Short, but he was never charged with wrongdoing.
   ``Certainly we made mistakes as does everyone, but I never ruled
in any way except in accordance with the rules,'' Short said five
years after his retirement.
   Short died of cardiac arrest Thursday at Methodist Hospital,
where he had been listed in serious to critical condition since he
was admitted Dec. 6, said hospital spokeswoman Brenda Cook.
   Survivors include his wife, Maxine; a son, Robert Short of
Houston; and two stepdaughters, Leslie Adams of Bastrop, Texas, and
Charlotte Bivins of Greenbrier, W.Va. Services are scheduled for
Saturday at Niday South Park Funeral Home in Pearland, Texas.
