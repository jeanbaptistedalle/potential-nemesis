   The best time of year to catch a glimpse of
migrating whales' slashing flukes and blowhole fountains begins
this week in Southern California with the arrival of the first of
20,000 Pacific gray whales.
   Whale-watching boat operators are gearing up for the peak season
that lures tourists and locals eager for a look at the whales that
swim 6,000 miles south for the winter.
   ``Many (whales) go out of their way to meet the boats to be
petted and touched,'' said Patricia Warhol of the American Cetacean
Society in San Pedro. ``They are curious about humans.''
   The whales' migration path from the Arctic Ocean to warmer
waters skirts the Aleutian Islands past British Columbia,
Washington, Oregon and California to shallow lagoons off Mexico's
Baja peninsula.
   The first whales, called front runners, are the expectant
females who arrive in Baja in late December, soon thereafter giving
birth and beginning to rear their young.
   Other adults and yearlings follow during a migration season that
runs through April.
   The whales, formerly called the California gray whales, were
listed as endangered animals in 1969 when their numbers were down
to about 3,000.
   But steps by the Mexican government to protect their breeding
grounds and other conservation efforts helped boost the gray whale
population.
