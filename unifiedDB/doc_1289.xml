   Acting President Matyas Szueros
announced today that the country's first competitive elections in
41 years will be held on March 25, the state MTI news agency
reported.
   On Thursday, Parliament approved a motion to dissolve itself on
March 16 to pave the way for the first multiparty elections since
1948.
   Hungary will become the first Soviet bloc country to hold free
elections resulting from the reform movement sweeping Eastern
Europe.
   A non-Communist government took power in Poland in August after
opposition candidates won all the seats they were allowed to
contest, then formed an alliance that forced the Communists to give
them control of the Cabinet.
   Free elections are expected next year in three other Soviet bloc
countries.
   East Germany has scheduled elections for May 6, and Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia have announced plans for free elections before the
end of June.
   In contrast to East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, where
popular revolts swiftly forced hard-line Communist leaders from
power, Hungary's evolution to democracy has been gradual.
   Legislation was passed in Parliament in October to set the legal
groundwork for the free elections, and the Communist Party
disbanded, reconstituting itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party
and aspiring to democratic ideals.
