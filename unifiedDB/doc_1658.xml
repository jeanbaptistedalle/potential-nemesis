<HEAD>Waite's Brother Says Events This Year Raise Hopes For Release</HEAD>

   The brother of Anglican church envoy Terry Waite
said Sunday he is optimistic about the eventual release of his
brother and other hostages in Lebanon because of events this year
in Britain, Iran and the United States.
   David Waite said he was encouraged by the election of a new
Iranian president, the inauguration of a new U.S. president and a
letter he received recently from British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd that outlined an avenue for improved Anglo-Iranian relations.
   ``I felt it was quite an important letter because he was saying
in fact that as long as Iran was ready to use her influence to
secure the release of Terry and the other hostages, Britain would
look to improve their relationships with Iran,'' Waite said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
   Citing the new administrations of Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani and President Bush as well as Hurd's letter, he said:
``So there has been a lot of change and a lot of hope, I feel, for
the future.''
   Waite, 50, the special envoy of Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel to negotiate with the Shiite fundamentalist group Islamic
Jihad for the release of two American hostages.
   No group has claimed to hold him, but he is widely believed to
be held by Islamic Jihad.
   Waite is one of 18 foreigners and four Britons missing in
Lebanon. American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent
for The Associated Press, is the longest-held Western hostage. He
was seized March 16, 1985.
