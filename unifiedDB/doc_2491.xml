   Three people flagged down a cab, forced
the driver out and drove off, but at least they paid the fare.
   Ken Sharp said that when police returned his cab to him
Thursday, the hijackers had left $96 in the door pocket, including
his change money and ``the 20 pound ($32) fare I'd asked for when
they first got in.''
   The 33-year-old man's cab was hijacked Wednesday and left by the
side of the road near Torquay, 150 miles southwest of London.
Police on Thursday returned the taxi, found 25 miles away in
Plymouth.
   ``Finding the money was surprising,'' said a police spokesman.
``It must be the Christmas spirit.''
