   Christmas and New Year's weekend traffic
accidents may claim as many as 770 lives this holiday season,
according to statisticians at the National Safety Council.
   The Chicago-based council issued its annual estimate Thursday,
basing it on data from previous years, seasonal weather factors and
national driving safety trends.
   The council said alcohol, a factor in more than half of all
fatal crashes, is a particular threat over the holidays, when
parties can lead to overindulgence.
   The council estimated between 320 and 420 people would die in
vehicular crashes during the official Christmas period, which
begins at 6 p.m. EST on Friday and ends at 11:59 p.m. local time
Monday.
   An additional 15,000 to 19,000 people may suffer disabling
injuries during the period, the council said.
   During last year's Christmas holiday, 386 people died and some
17,900 were injured.
   For the New Year's holiday period, which begins at 6 p.m. EST,
Friday, Dec, 29, and runs through 11:59 p.m., local time, Monday,
Jan. 1, the council predicted between 250 and 350 fatalities, plus
from 12,000 to 16,000 disabling injuries.
   Last year, 317 people died and about 14,700 suffered disabling
injuries over the New Year's period.
