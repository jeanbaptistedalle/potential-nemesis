   A gas explosion leveled a vacant house and
critically injured a worker investigating reports of a leak in the
area, police and company officials said.
   The injured worker, Jack Sedar of Colonia, was listed in
critical condition in the burn center at St. Barnabas Medical
Center in Livingston following Friday's explosion.
   Sedar and another employee, who was not identified, had gone to
the home of an Elizabethtown Gas Co. customer who reported smelling
fumes, said company spokesman Chris Reardon.
   After discovering gas fumes in several other homes, the second
employee entered a vacant house to investigate, Reardon said.
   An explosion rocked the house, sending its sides outward and on
top of Sedar, who was near the side door, Reardon said. It was not
known what ignited the explosion.
   The other employee was in the basement and suffered only minor
cuts and bruises.
   A preliminary investigation showed the leak was caused by a
crack in an 8-inch main that most likely was caused by shifting
ground, Reardon said.
