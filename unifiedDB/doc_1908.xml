   Special presents arrived Christmas Eve
for two soldiers fighting supporters of deposed Gen. Manuel Noriega
in Panama _ their wives each gave birth to a baby girl.
   There was some indication that both new fathers were hoping for
future paratroopers, but one new mother took it in stride. ``We've
got paratrooper women,'' Courtny Hollands, 26, said from her
hosptial bed at Fort Bragg's Womack Army Community Hospital, where
she gave birth to Lindsay Suzanne.
   Staff Sgt. Curtis Rosenbaum of the 82nd Airborne Division's 1st
Squadron received a message Christmas Day about his new daughter,
Ashley Ann, who was born to his wife, Becky. He called home to
confirm the good news.
   ``He said, `Is it true? Is it true?''' said Mrs. Rosenbaum's
mother, Linda Glidewell of Hico, Texas.
   Rosenbaum called his wife Saturday and found out she was in
labor, Mrs. Rosenbaum, 22, said. ``He was going, `Can't you wait
three weeks?''' she said.
   Mrs. Glidewell said she thinks her son-in-law was surprised that
the child is a girl.
   ``I think they were expecting a boy because he wanted a
paratrooper,'' she said.
   Capt. Dave Hollands, 29, of 3rd Battalion, 319th Artillery, was
sent word Christmas Day about his daughter's birth, but Mrs.
Hollands said she had not yet spoken with her husband.
   ``I did get a message sixth-hand (saying) `Did she have my son
yet?' Typical man,'' she said.
   The babies were the first for both couples.
