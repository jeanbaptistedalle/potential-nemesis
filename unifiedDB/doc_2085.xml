   A mailman accused of fatally shooting a dog
named Skippy allegedly opened fire as the dog's owner was headed
outside to give the mailman a bottle of vodka for Christmas, police
said.
   ``I got to the door, and boom,'' said Tammie Brody, 27, owner of
the 2-year-old German shepherd mix. ``I don't know what happened.
He just freaked out and shot the dog ... for absolutely no reason.''
   Letter carrier Floyd Bertran Sterling, 34, of Pacoima, was
arrested after the 1:45 p.m. shooting Tuesday in suburban Arleta,
20 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, police Officer Sidney
Benaske said.
   Sterling was released without being booked, but the case was
handed over to the district attorney's office for possible
misdemeanor charges of cruelty to animals or discharging a weapon
in city limits, Benaske said.
   Sterling was on his rounds when he allegedly shot Skippy with a
22-caliber weapon from the driveway while the dog was about 15 feet
away on the sidewalk, police said.
   Ms. Brody said she had just stepped to the door to give the
letter carrier a bottle of vodka tied with a green bow.
   Sterling, a letter carrier in the neighborhood for about four
years, told police he had been bitten by Skippy and had complained
about the animal to postal officials, Benaske said.
   But Ms. Brody said Sterling had gotten along well with the dog.
   ``He was a very friendly dog. The mailman knows him _ he watched
him grow. I don't know why he would do that (shoot the dog). He's a
very nice man,'' she said.
   Postal officials said the matter was under investigation.
