   Airlines and the Postal Service
struggled to make up for lost time as Redoubt Volcano slackened a
week into its first eruptions in 23 years.
   Flights were added Wednesday to supplement those reinstated a
day earlier after airborne volcanic ash cut into the state's air
transportation lifeline.
   Alaska Airlines, the main interstate carrier serving Anchorage,
said it had erased a passenger backlog in Seattle and reduced the
number of standbys in Anchorage.
   International airlines continued to divert flights away from
Alaska's largest city because of concerns about engine-clogging ash
from the volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The Postal Service said mail could be back to normal by today. A
backlog was caused by the need to use slower, less ash-sensitive
propeller planes instead of jets.
