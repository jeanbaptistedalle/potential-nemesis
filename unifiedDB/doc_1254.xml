<TEXT>
   The Soviet Congress today passed a resolution
expressing serious concern over the unrest in Romania, calling for
a peaceful end to what has become a bloody popular challenge to
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The resolution by the Congress of People's Deputies was adopted
after President Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced that information
received from Soviet diplomats in Romania indicated the situation
had seriously worsened overnight.
   He did not elaborate.
   The resolution expressed hopes for a peaceful settlement of
Romania's problems ``in the spirit of tolerance, humaneness and
respect for human rights.''
