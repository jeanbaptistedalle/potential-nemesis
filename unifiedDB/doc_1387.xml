   Harvard historian David Donald, a two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner, will inaugurate a lecture series on the
presidency, the White House said Friday.
   Donald will speak about Abraham Lincoln on Jan. 7 in the State
Dining Room before an audience of about 100 invited guests.
President and Mrs. Bush will be the hosts.
   A White House announcement said several lectures will be given
each year by historians, biographers and distinguished authors on
the presidency.
   Donald, a professor of American history at Harvard University,
has written a number of books about Lincoln and the Civil War
including ``Lincoln's Herndon,'' ``Divided We Fought,'' ``Inside
Lincoln's Cabinet'' and ``Lincoln Reconsidered.''
   He has twice received the Pulitzer Prize for biography.
