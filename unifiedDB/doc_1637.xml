   A fugitive convicted as a leader of a
cocaine-smuggling operation was flown to the United States today
after the Colombian government turned him over to American
authorities, the U.S. Marshals Service said.
   Victor Eduardo Mera-Mosquera, 36, is the 11th person extradited
from Colombia since that country began its crackdown against drug
traffickers in August, U.S. Marshals Service Director K. Michael
Moore said in a statement.
   Mera-Mosquera, a native of Colombia, fled the United States in
1984, just before the trial in New York where he was found guilty
of numerous cocaine offenses, said the statement.
   The fugitive was arrested by Colombian police in the city of
Cali on Oct. 13 and turned over Saturday night to U.S. Marshals,
who flew him back to New York City early today. He was being held
at an undisclosed location pending a court hearing to set a date
for his sentencing, the Marshals Service said.
   According to the Marshals Service, Mera-Mosquera fled the United
States as he was awaiting trial in Feb. 1984 when he was freed from
custody in the mistaken belief that he had been ordered released.
   While still a fugitive, Mera-Mosquera was convicted in U.S.
District Court in Manhattan along with 10 other people of the drug
charges. The indictment charged that he was one of two leaders of
an organization that dealt in ``massive quantities of cocaine,''
the Marshals Service said.
   The Marshals Service carries out the extraditions of persons in
foreign nations who are charged with violating federal laws in the
United States.
