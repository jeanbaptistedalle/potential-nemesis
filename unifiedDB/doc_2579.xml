   The White House on Friday turned up
its nose at advertisements for a decongestant featuring President
Bush and Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``Heads of state don't
endorse cold medicine,'' Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater registered objections to ads for Drixoral, an
over-the-counter head cold remedy manufactured by Schering-Plough
Corp.
   The ads, in both newspaper and television versions, show
Gorbachev and Bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in Malta
earlier this month.
   ``In the New Year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
we're fighting,'' asserts the advertisements.
   But the ads clearly are giving the White House a headache.
   ``We do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television
networks that declined to run them,'' said Fitzwater.
   ABC and CBS have refused to carry the spot.
   ``Some ad man gets high marks for imagination and ingenuity, but
he may have to pay for this one himself,'' Fitzwater said. He did
not elaborate.
