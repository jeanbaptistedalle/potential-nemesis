<TEXT>
   President Omar Bongo has banned
elephant hunting and the ivory trade throughout this Central
African country, government officials said Saturday.
   Bongo issued the decree during a Cabinet meeting Friday,
officials said. The ruling suspends certificates already granted to
hunt elephants or to sell or work with ivory.
   The ban follows a decision at the September conference of the
Convention for International Trade in Endangered Species to forbid
its member nations to traffic in ivory.
   Elephants are in danger of extinction in much of Africa as
poachers massacre entire herds for their prized tusks.
