<HEAD>White House Press Office Closes For Holiday</HEAD>

   Despite the U.S. fighting in Panama, the White
House and State Department closed their press offices Friday night
for a long holiday weekend, not to reopen until the Tuesday after
Christmas.
   ``Any details on the military situation on the ground will come
from the Defense Department,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The Pentagon planned to keep its press office open on Saturday.
After that, the Pentagon planned to follow the State Department and
White House in the practice of having a press duty officer
available by telephone.
   ``We do not expect to release any new information here unless
there's a dramatic turn in events,'' Fitzwater said at his briefing.
   Of course, the most dramatic event would be the capture or death
of deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the target of a U.S.
manhunt in Panama.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III were booked for appearances Sunday on network talk shows.
   The State Department's Panama task force was to remain staffed
around the clock.
   Cheney cancelled a holiday trip to Wyoming and other plans to
remain in Washington to monitor the battle for Panama.
   President Bush, meanwhile, settled in at Camp David in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains for a five-day stay. He was to
receive regular updates and daily briefings from Brent Scowcroft,
his national security adviser, as well as Cheney and Baker.
   Bush will remain at his presidential retreat until he departs
Wednesday for a vacation trip to Texas, returning to Washington on
New Year's Day.
