   The Salvation Army in this
southeastern Massachusetts city has closed its doors because it has
run out of money, because of what officials said was an sharp
increase of people seeking aid.
   ``We've gone into using the canned food we had put aside for
January and February,'' Maj. Robert Pfeiffer, who runs the office,
said Thursday.
   Pfeiffer blamed local unemployment for bringing 1,600 families
to the office in the past year _ 300 more than last year. There
have been about 1,000 layoffs in the area in the last month, he
said.
   Pfeiffer said he didn't know when the office will reopen, but he
said he expects the doors to remain closed just through the
Christmas season.
   When he closed the doors at 2 p.m. Thursday, there were still
about 100 people waiting for help.
   ``We're going to help them, but at this point, we can't take any
more,'' he said.
