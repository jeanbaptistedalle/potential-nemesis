   About 36 million people nationwide are planning
to travel at least 100 miles away from home during the Christmas
weekend, a survey is projecting, and safety officials are urging
motorists to be extra careful.
   A national survey of 1,500 adults the U.S. Travel Data Center
conducted for the AAA-Chicago Motor Club found that 35.8 million
people _ the highest in five years _ are planning to travel during
the Christmas weekend.
   The holiday officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at 11:59
p.m. on Dec. 25. About 5.2 million people plan to travel by car,
the survey found.
   With so many motorists on the roads and highways, between 320
and 420 people could be killed in car accidents, the National
Safety Council said.
   An additional 15,000 to 19,000 people could suffer disabling
injuries, the Safety Council said.
   During the Christmas holiday season last year, 386 people died
in car accidents and about 17,900 were injured.
   Motorists are urged to avoid drinking and driving and to wear
seatbelts, said Bob O'Brien, a spokesman for the Safety Council.
   In addition, travelers should gas up their cars early because
about two-thirds of the nation's gas stations will be closed on
Christmas, AAA-Chicago said.
