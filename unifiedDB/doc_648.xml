   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchage reversed
its early downswing and edged up Wednesday, while the dollar firmed
against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.80 yen. It started trading at 143.92 yen and ranged
between 143.90 yen and 144.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 72.90
points, or 0.19 percent, ending the day at 38,512.00. It lost
147.08 points Tuesday on rumors the Bank of Japan might raise the
nation's discount rate by the weekend.
   Market players, however, avoided making major moves amid
uncertainties over the discount-rate increase, said Tomoyuki
Morimoto, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Many market players were reluctant to make major moves amid
uncertainty over the discount rate hike,'' he said. ``Few people
will be inclined to buy further until they find out what exactly
will happen to the rate.''
   Higher interest rates discourage stock investment.
   News reports speculated the Bank of Japan might raise its key
lending rate to commercial banks by 0.5 percentage point to 4.25
percent, but both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan denied
the hike would happen any time soon.
   Kyodo News Service reported Wednesday the central bank will
begin negotiations with the government in an attempt to raise the
discount rate soon, citing sources from within the Bank of Japan.
   In currency dealings, trading was quiet in the absence of fresh
market-affecting news ahead of the Christmas holiday, traders said.
   ``Although the market was hectic yesterday due to the rumor
about the discount rate, it no longer has any impact here. The
market already expects there will be a hike sometime early next
year,'' said a trader with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
