   A pickup truck slammed into an
overturned tanker carrying 1,100 gallons of fuel, triggering an
explosion and wall of fire and killing four people, authorities
said.
   The driver of the tanker was not in the vehicle and thus escaped
injury in Wednesday night's crash on Interstate 10, said Capt. Rick
Stone of the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
   The four fatalities were all inside the pickup truck that
smashed into the rear of the tanker, Stone said. The identities of
the victims and the tanker driver were not immediately available.
   The fire was finally doused about 3 a.m., and both eastbound and
westbound lanes of the interstate were reopened by 6:30 a.m., said
Officer Joe Johnson.
   The driver of the tanker owned by Dedicated Transportation Co.
was westbound on the freeway in Montclair, about 35 miles east of
Los Angeles, when he lost control of the vehicle and its rear
trailer overturned, said Stone.
   While the tanker driver was outside checking the damage, the
pickup hit it, setting off the explosion and fire, he said.
   Although early reports said the tanker had been carrying 20,000
gallons of fuel, Stone said the tanker held only 1,100 gallons. The
tanker had a capacity for 8,800 gallons, he said.
