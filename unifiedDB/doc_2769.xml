   Three mild earthquakes occurred near
Yugoslavia's only nuclear power plant Saturday, but no damage was
reported. The facility had just reopened after being closed by
earlier quakes.
   No injuries or other damage were reported from Saturday's
tremors, which shook the Krsko area in northwest Yugoslavia, the
Tanjug news agency said.
   The official report said the first tremor measured four on the
12-point Mercalli scale and that the others were weaker.
   A police source in Slovenia, where Krsko is located, said in a
telephone interview that the plant remained running during and
after the tremors.
   The plant had just reopened Friday after being closed following
four quakes on Thursday that measured up to 3.4 on the Mercalli
scale. The Mercalli scale runs from 1 to 12.
