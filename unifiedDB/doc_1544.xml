   Here is a look at major developments in Eastern Europe today:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ROMANIA:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Army troops and citizens defending their day-old popular revolt
battled units of the security forces that kept dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu in power. Hundreds of people were killed in fighting in
Bucharest and other cities after Ceausescu fled the capital Friday.
His whereabouts remained unknown.

<NOTE>SOVIET UNION:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Congress his government was
ready to aid the forces in Romania that overthrew Nicolae Ceausescu
only to find themselves fighting pro-Ceausescu security forces. But
Gorbachev did not specify besides medicine what kind of aid Moscow
was prepared to give the provisional government that struggled to
gain control of Romania.

<NOTE>POLAND:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The top financial officials of the Solidarity-led government
signed a letter of intent for the International Monetary Fund,
pledging far-reaching and painful economic reforms in return for
massive Western aid.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>EAST GERMANY:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Berliners poured through new Berlin Wall
border crossings at the Brandenburg Gate for a final, frantic day
of Christmas shopping in the well-stocked stores of the West.
   Other Berliners headed for home after singing and dancing late
into the night at the newly opened gate, which has been transformed
from a symbol of Germany's divisions into one of East-West
rapprochement.
