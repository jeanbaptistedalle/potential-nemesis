   The cold spell that put parts of the country in
a deep freeze continued to make heating oil a hot commodity
Tuesday, but traders said the frenzied price rally has slowed as
many dealers decided to cash in on the recent runup.
   ``Clearly it ran up just a little too far and a little too
fast,'' said John Hill, a vice president for Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures. ``Some of the buying we saw was panic buying.
   ``Yes, it's cold ... and there's some tightness in supply, but
we're not running out of heating oil.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
No. 2 home heating oil rose 0.35 cent to 75.01 cents a gallon,
after soaring more than 7 cents in the last two trading sessions.
   Traders said profit-taking kept the price from rising even
higher, and the feeling that the current cold temperatures and
inclement weather won't last too much longer helped push down the
prices of contracts for February, March and April.
   Still, the current wholesale price is now at the highest level
since the winter of 1985-86, according to Hill.
   Meanwhile, the January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was up 11 cents to settle at
$22.33 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The contract had jumped $1.12 on Monday to an eight-month high,
but traders attributed that sharp increase largely to the fact that
the contract was set to expire on Tuesday.
   January unleaded gasoline lost 0.58 cent to close at 53.93 cents
a gallon, after gaining 1.71 cents on Monday.
   Some traders attributed that drop to internal market influences.
