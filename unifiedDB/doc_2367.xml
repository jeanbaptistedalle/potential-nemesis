   Peru's ambassador to Panama, Mario Castro, has
resigned because of differences with President Alan Garcia over
Panama, according to a letter made public Thursday.
   Castro said in his resignation letter that he was leaving
because of ``substantial differences'' with the Garcia government's
position concerning the ``Panamanian problem.'' He also cited the
``injurious language employed to describe democratic leaders'' in
Panama.
   Garcia recalled Castro from Panama City three months ago to show
displeasure with the regime of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   But the president condemned the U.S. invasion of Panama and
refused to recognize the government of Guillermo Endara, installed
after U.S. troops ousted Noriega. Castro has publicly expressed his
support for the Endara government, however.
   Foreign Minister Guillermo Larco Cox called Endara a ``Judas,''
suggesting he betrayed other Latin American lands by going along
with the U.S. action.
   In a news interview, Castro opposed Garcia's call for new
elections in Panama. He said Endara qualified as legitimate
president of Panama because of his victory in the May 7 elections,
which Noriega annulled.
   ``The votes that elected Mr. Endara are just as valid as those
that elected Alan Garcia'' in 1985, Castro said.
