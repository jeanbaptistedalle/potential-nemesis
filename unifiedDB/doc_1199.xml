   Air Canada said Thursday it sold about one-third
of its shares in GPA Group PLC for a total of $212 million.
   Air Canada said it sold 326,000 of its nearly 880,000 shares, or
37 percent, in the Shannon, Ireland-based aircraft leasing company
for an after-tax gain of about $109 million.
   The sale leaves Air Canada as the third-largest shareholder,
with 9.3 percent, in GPA, behind Mitsubishi Trust Bank of Japan and
Aer Lingus of Ireland. Air Canada owned 14.3 percent of GPA before
the stock sale.
   An Air Canada spokesman said the gain would be included in the
airline's fourth-quarter results.
   Air Canada said the GPA shares it sold were placed by GPA with
financial institutions and insurance companies in Canada, Ireland,
Japan and the United States.
