   The stock market pushed ahead today in the last
session of a decade of dramatic gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 9.38 to 2,741.68 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 556 up, 445 down and
567 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.67 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were buying in hopes that the market could
get off to a strong start on 1990 next week.
   Much anticipatory attention has focused of late on the so-called
``January effect,'' a historical tendency for the market in general
and small stocks in particular to do well in the early stages of a
year.
   But brokers also cited persistent worries about the outlook for
the economy over the next several months.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the index of
leading economic indicators rose 0.1 percent in November after
posting a revised 0.3 percent decline the month before.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up { at
41|; International Business Machines, up ] at 94{; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at 46[, and Eastman Kodak, up [ at 40~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
.58 to 194.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .11 at 374.01.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.90 to
2,732.30.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 on the
NYSE, with 835 up, 673 down and 469 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 128.03 million shares, against 133.73
million in the previous session.
