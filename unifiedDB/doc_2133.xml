   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh announced
Wednesday he will proceed with plans to dismantle the Justice
Department's organized crime strike forces despite some
congressional claims the move is unwarranted.
   Starting Jan. 1, the 14 strike forces will be folded into 23
U.S. attorneys offices across the country, Thornburgh said in a
statement.
   ``I am convinced that this new organizational structure will not
only strengthen our efforts against traditional organized criminal
families, but will enhance our efforts against new organized crime
elements,'' Thornburgh said.
   Additionally, Thornburgh said he would create an Organized Crime
Council in Washington to oversee the federal goverment's attack on
organized crime.
   He defended the reorganization, which had been revealed
previously, on the grounds that traditional organized crime run by
Mafia families has changed, with the mob often working in tandem
with Colombian drug cartels and others.
   Moreover, organized crime is also operated by elements in the
Asian community and gangs ``such as the Crips and Bloods and the
Jamaican posses.''
   In letters to members of the House and Senate judiciary
committees, Thornburgh also said his plan ``offers substantial
managerial benefits that should not longer be postponed.''
   Earlier, he said the plan would end ``turf battles'' between the
strike forces and the U.S. attorneys' offices.
