<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A tenant behind in his payments pushed his vocal
chords to the limit by shouting, ``Hey landlord, wait three days
more for my rent!'' to win the annual Halls Year-End Loud Voice
Contest.
   Hiroyuki Saito, 28, hit 120.0 decibels on the sound meter on
Wednesday to win the ninth annual shouting contest along with $360.
   Toru Komoriyama, a 24-year-old television reporter, took second
place by hollering, ``I want to be rich!'' Komoriyama warbled the
meter at 117.9 decibels and won $215.
   Company employee Shigemi Okada, 27, shrieked ``Don't use chicken
in the beef barbecue!'' at 115.9 decibels to take third place and
$140 in the raucous contest, held outside a Tokyo train station.
   In the special ``unique shout'' category also carrying a $140
prize, student Kosuke Ushijima, 22, bellowed ``Gorby, you're doing
a good job! Best wishes with perestroika!'' won for the men in
110.7 decibels.
   Lovesick Hisayo Nishikawa, 25, yelled ``Hideaki, please wait for
me in New York! I'll go next year!'' in an ear-piercing 112.6
decibels to take the women's prize. Hideaki, a man's name, was not
identified.
   A telephone ringing registers about 50 decibels, while traffic
noise is about 100. One risks one's hearing at 150 decibels.
