   U.S. textile imports rose by 13 percent and
their value climbed to more than $32 billion in 1989, the American
Textile Manufacturers Institute said.
   Imports of cloth and clothes increased to 12.19 billion square
meters this year from 10.74 billion square meters in 1988, the
institute said Wednesday. The U.S. market, though, increased by
only 4 percent, the industry group said.
   Imports were valued at $32.36 billion, compared with $29.63
billion last year. The biggest increases came from China and Taiwan
and smaller increases from Canada and Thailand, institute
spokeswoman Deborah Anderson said.
   U.S. imports are held down by a series of agreements between
industrial countries and Third World exporters. Textiles are a
major industrial export of Third World countries, since large
quantities can be produced with labor that requires little training.
   U.S. exports rose to $5.952 billion from $5.226 billion last
year. After-tax profits of the U.S. textile industry rose to an
estimated $1.7 billion from $1.6 billion in 1988.
   ``This year brought still larger numbers of textile and apparel
imports into this country, which had a direct negative impact on
employment in the domestic industry,'' said institute president
Edward P. Schrum said in a statement.
   The institute reported 727,090 jobs in the U.S. industry this
year, compared with 729,000 in 1988. Average weekly earnings rose
to $313.85 from $302.96, it said.
