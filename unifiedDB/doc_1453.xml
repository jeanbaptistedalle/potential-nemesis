   Billionaire industrialist H. Ross Perot is
offering to pay travel expenses for families wishing to journey to
the bedside of servicemen wounded in Panama.
   The Dallas businessman has extended the offer to all families of
the 191 servicemen being treated at Wilford Hall Medical Center and
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, said Wilford Hall
spokeswoman Sgt. Debra Morrison.
   The 59-year-old Texan has been the recipient of several awards
for public service.
   Perot was unavailable for comment Thursday.
   USAA, the San Antonio-based insurance company, also is offering
money for airline tickets and hotel accommodations, said spokesman
Paul Shattenberg.
