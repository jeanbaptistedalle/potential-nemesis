   Relatives and not the World Wildlife Fund
will divide the estate of a man who went on a shooting rampage two
years ago and killed six members of his family.
   An out-of-court settlement has been reached to distribute the
estate of Robert Dreesman, 40, who allegedly killed his parents,
and his widowed sister and her three children when they sat down to
dinner on Dec. 30, 1987. He then turned the gun on himself,
according to authorities.
   Nineteen days before the slayings, he had drafted a will leaving
each member of his family $1 and leaving the rest of his estate,
estimated to be worth about $500,000, to the World Wildlife Fund.
   But surviving family members filed wrongful death claims against
his estate, claiming loss of future income from John Dreesman, 79,
and his wife, Agnes, 74.
   Wayne Forgey, executor of the parents' estate, said all parties
had agreed to distribute the assets to relatives, with an
independent third-party investigator, Wayne Newkirk of Winterset,
to decide how to divide the money.
