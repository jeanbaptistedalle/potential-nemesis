   A couple, their son and their daughter were
found slain in their home Saturday morning after it was set on
fire, police said.
   State troopers discovered the bodies after neighbors heard a
smoke alarm in the house and called police at 7:07 a.m.,
authorities said. Firefighters put the blaze out before much damage
was done.
   State police Capt. Robert Farrand identified the dead as Warren
Anthony Harris, 39; his wife, Delores, 41; 11-year-old son Mark;
and 15-year-old daughter Shelby.
   Farrand, who is in charge of the investigation, said the fire in
this village of 1,500 people about 50 miles south of Syracuse was
being investigated as arson.
   He said police would not release more information on the
slayings, saying the investigation was extremely sensitive.
   Police said they had no suspects. Investigators interviewed
Dryden residents in an attempt to recreate the last 24 hours of the
Harrises' life.
   Police set up a command post at a church near the house, and
authorities asked anyone with information to call police.
   The Onondaga County Medical Examiner's office was expected to
perform autopsies on the Harrises on Sunday.
   The Onondaga and Tompkins counties district attorneys' offices
were also taking part in the investigation.
