   Federal marshals arrested the Rev. Daniel
Berrigan on Friday for boycotting his arraignment in New Orleans on
charges stemming from a Dec. 1 demonstration at the federal
building there.
   The longtime anti-war protester, charged with blocking the
building's lobby, wrote Magistrate Alma Chasez in New Orleans on
Dec. 11 to say he would not return for his court appearance because
he believed his prosecution was ``wildly excessive.''
   The court clerk issued a warrant for his arrest for failing to
appear and marshals picked him up early Friday morning at his
Manhattan home.
   Federal Magistrate Nina Gershon in Manhattan scheduled a hearing
for Jan. 12 on Berrigan's removal to New Orleans and released him
on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond.
   Berrigan, 68, himself a Jesuit priest, said in his letter to
Chasez that he would contribute the equivalent of New York-New
Orleans round-trip air fare to a Salvadoran relief fund.
