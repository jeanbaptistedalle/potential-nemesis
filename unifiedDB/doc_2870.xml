<HEAD>Help Wanted Index Falls, Shows Weakening Labor Market</HEAD>

   A widely watched measure of the labor market
sent out weak signals in November, a business research group said
in a report for release today.
   The Conference Board said its Help-Wanted Index dropped six
points in November, erasing almost all of October's five-point gain.
   The seasonally adjusted index fell to 145 in November from
October's 151 and September's 146. The November reading was 11
points lower than the year- earlier level.
   ``As the decade ends, the economy is not now growing fast enough
to keep up with the rise in the working-age population,''
Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said. ``Consequently, new
entrants, or re-entrants, to the work force spend a little more
time finding jobs,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, this is a weakened labor market but not a declining
one,'' he said, noting that the U.S. unemployment rate probably
will edge up in 1990.
   The jobless rate was 5.4 percent in November, up from 5.3
percent in October and the same as in November of 1988. Goldstein
said the rate may rise to 5.8 percent by June.
   Job advertising volume fell in seven of the nine regions of the
country measured by the New York-based research group. Only the
East South Central and Mountain regions showed increases while New
England continued to be the weakest as it has been for several
months.
   The Help-Wanted Index is based on ad volume in 51 major
newspapers across the country. The Conference Board says ad volume
has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions and provides
a gauge of change in the supply of jobs.
