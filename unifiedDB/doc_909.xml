   The board of directors of NCR Corp. on
Wednesday authorized the repurchase of up to 15 million shares, or
about 21 percent, of NCR's common stock over the next two years.
   The company said the planned buyback was part of NCR's
continuing stock repurchase program.
   Last December, the board authorized the buyback of 10 million
shares over a two-year period. All but 618,000 of the shares
authorized by that action have been repurchased, the company said
in a statement.
   There are about 70.6 million shares of NCR common stock
outstanding, the company said.
   NCR develops, manufactures and markets business information
processing systems.
