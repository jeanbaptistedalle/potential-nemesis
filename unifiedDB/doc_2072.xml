   Random shots apparently fired by drug dealers
``flexing their muscles'' killed two bystanders, including a woman
who died after giving birth to a healthy boy, police said.
   Lisa Biffle, 26, who was nine months pregnant, died Tuesday at
Queens Hospital Center. She had been shot in the abdomen late
Monday as she sat in a car in front of the South Jamaica Housing
Project.
   The bullet missed the baby, who was delivered two hours later by
Caesarean section and was in good condition.
   A Jehovah's Witness, Mrs. Biffle declined blood transfusions for
religious reasons, said her father, Hugh Carter.
   The shots were fired by three or four men who drove by.
   The other victim, Ebony Williams, 18, was shot in the head as
she stopped at a phone booth to call a cab to take her and a friend
to the movies, said Police Lt. Eugene Dunbar.
   Wounded in the shooting was Mrs. Biffle's husband, Dwayne, 25,
who was in fair condition after being shot in the foot.
   Ms. Williams and the Biffles ``were definitely innocent
victims,'' Dunbar said. ``These people happened to be in the wrong
spot.''
   There was no known motive for the shooting, but Dunbar said
investigators believed ``it's probably some drug dealers flexing
their muscles.''
