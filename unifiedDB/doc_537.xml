   The specialists at the North
American Aerospace Defense Command here who constantly scan the
skies for enemy activity will take on additional duties here Sunday
night to watch for an old friend.
   The radar, satellites and space-age sensors of NORAD will be
watching for the unarmed, subsonic sleigh of Santa Claus.
   ``The procedure is laid down by tradition,'' said Air Force Maj.
Dick Adam of NORAD Public Affairs. ``We've been doing it for so
long it's standard operating procedure for us by now.''
   NORAD's tradition of tracking the jolly holiday visitor began in
December 1955, early in the Cold War, as it monitored the DEW
(Distant Early Warning) Line of radars set up in Greenland and
Canada.
   When Col. Harry Shoup answered the ``hotline'' in the combat
operations center one evening before Christmas, a small voice
asked, ``Is this one of Santa's helpers?''
   Shoup found that a newspaper advertisement had misprinted a
telephone number for children to call Santa, printing the defense
command's unlisted hotline number instead.
   More calls poured in and soon the center was awash in Christmas
spirit.
   An airman on duty soon drew Santa with his sleigh and reindeer
over North America on a glass ``plotting board'' used for
displaying air traffic, and another called the news media to report
an object had lifted off from the North Pole and was headed toward
North America.
   The airman reported jet fighters were being ``scrambled'' to
intercept it, and they later reported it was Santa Claus.
   Every Christmas Eve since then, NORAD has found and escorted
Santa Claus over North America.
