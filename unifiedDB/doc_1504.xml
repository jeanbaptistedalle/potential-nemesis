   A cave explorer pinned 60 feet beneath the surface
by a 1,000-pound boulder was rescued Friday night by emergency
crews, authorities said.
   The man, whose legs were trapped by the huge rock, was pinned
for more than two hours in freezing temperatures. His name, age and
condition were not immediately known.
   Lt. George Meek of the Travis County Sheriff's Department said
deputies and Austin firefighters pulled the explorer out of the
cave in a wilderness area southwest of Austin at about 10 p.m.
   Meek said the man was part of a group of spelunkers, or cave
explorers, which apparently lacked permission to be on the
property. ``From what we understand, the owner of the property is
not a happy camper'' Meek said.
   Sheriff's spokesman Curtis Weeks said the man was the last one
trying to leave the cave when the boulder fell on his legs,
trapping him about 2{ hours.
   While about 50 rescue workers labored to free the man,
temperatures Friday night plunged into the single digits with
sub-zero wind chills.
   Meek said the sheriff's office was notified of the accident
about 7:30 p.m. Meek said he unsure just how the boulder was moved
to free the explorer.
   Meek said the cave is in a protected area along Barton Creek on
a rancher's private land.
