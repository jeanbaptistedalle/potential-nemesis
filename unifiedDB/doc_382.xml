   ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' was
the nation's No. 1 movie last weekend, displacing the dark comedy
``The War of the Roses.''
   ``She-Devil,'' teaming TV's Roseanne Barr and Oscar winner Meryl
Streep, fell from fourth to out of the Top 10, and the Eddie
Murphy-Richard Pryor collaboration ``Harlem Nights'' dropped from
sixth to 10th place.
   Warner Bros.' ``Christmas Vacation,'' starring Chevy Chase,
moved up from second on a $7.23 million return last weekend while
``The War of the Roses,'' with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas
as dueling spouses, slipped to No. 2.
   ``Back to the Future Part II'' was third. The film has collected
$75.5 million since Thanksgiving weekend.
   Disney's animated feature ``The Little Mermaid'' was fourth and
``The Wizard,'' starring TV's young Fred Savage as a video game
whiz, opened at No. 5.
   ``Family Business,'' starring Dustin Hoffman, Sean Connery and
Matthew Broderick, had a disappointing debut, earning $2.1 million
and finishing sixth.
   Finishing seventh was the all-star ensemble ``Steel Magnolias,''
and the pairing of two other big stars, Robert DeNiro and Sean
Penn, produced an eighth-place debut for ``We're No Angels.''
   The Paul Newman-starring ``Blaze,'' the story of Louisiana Gov.
Earl Long's love affair with stripper Blaze Starr, opened at No. 9
with $1.7 million.
   Joining ``She-Devil'' in the drop from the Top 10 were ``Look
Who's Talking,'' ``Prancer'' and ``All Dogs Go to Heaven.''
