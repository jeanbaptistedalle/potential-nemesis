<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Announces 300 Job Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Tuesday it will cut
about 300 jobs due to the sale of some clearing accounts from the
company's Broadcort Capital Corp. subsidiary to Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Merrill Lynch said in a
statement that the ``selected staff reductions'' would occur at
Broadcort and related Merrill Lynch support areas over the next few
months.
   Merrill Lynch said the agreement primarily would affect
clearings of Broadcort's retail-oriented accounts. Clearings are
the financial settlements of clients' securities transactions.
   Retail transactions account for about 45 percent of Broadcort's
current business. Merrill spokesman Fred Yager declined to say how
much of the retail activity was being transferred to Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's Pershing Division.
   Yager said the changes are part of a restructuring announced by
Merrill Lynch executives last month. The firm said it would realign
or eliminate unprofitable areas, cut operating costs and trim
investment bankers' bonuses because of a prolonged slump in the
securities industry.
   Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest retail brokerage with 40,500
employees and 12,600 brokers worldwide, also said layoffs were
likely but it did not give an estimate.
   Yager said the job cuts related to the Broadcort transaction
would be achieved through attrition and transfers. Broadcort,
formed in 1977, is a unit of Merrill Lynch's Professional
Securities Services Group in the firm's equity markets division.
