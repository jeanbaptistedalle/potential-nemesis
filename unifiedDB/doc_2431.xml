   Prices ended mixed on London's Stock Exchange
Thursday after early strength was undermined by the pound's
weakness and profit-taking.
   The market drifted amid very light volume, dealers said.
   Stocks opened strongly in the wake of Wednesday's gains. But
then selling aimed at collecting profits and a weak pound pushed
shares lower.
   The market was sent to a session low by news that Hillsborough
Holdings Corp., a company owned by leveraged buyout specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
   ``The news was expected in the U.S.,'' one dealer said, ``but
here in London we weren't sure at first how to interpret it.''
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 3.0
points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 2,398.8.
   The index climbed to its session high of 2,411.8 at mid-morning,
and hit its low of 2,396.2 at midafternoon.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 0.7 point at 1,896.2
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 3.11 points
to close at 1,298.96.
   Volume amounted to 410.2 million shares, up from Wednesday's
extremely light 223.3 million shares.
