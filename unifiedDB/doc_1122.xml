   People have an extra reason for celebrating
Christmas this year _ the end of the Cold War between West and
East, says the president of the United Methodist Council of Bishops.
   Declaring the year has seen the ``unfolding of events in the
family of nations which hold the promise of a truly better day for
humankind,'' Bishop Jack Tuell of Los Angeles said in a Christmas
message:
   ``Long-standing repressive regimes have yielded to the cries of
the people for a fuller measure of the freedom and dignity with
which God has endowed all of humanity.
   ``Groups long separated by artificial political barriers now are
coming together to form new relationships of community and
cooperation. The God who is the God of peace and justice and
freedom is surely at work in all this.''

abortion.

   Randall A. Terry, who founded the
anti-abortion movement ``Operation Rescue,'' has been named for the
Christian Herald magazine's annual ``James 1:22 Award'' as a
leading ``doer of the Word'' in 1989.
   His ``controversial and dramatic tactics have forced Christians
to either join the fight over abortion or turn their backs on the
babies and mothers,'' said Bob Chuvala, editor of the 113-year-old
evangelical magazine.

   Amid the injustices in the world and wasteful
exploitation of nature, the World Council of Churches general
secretary says Christmas raises a beacon of hope.
   The Rev. Emilio Castro said in a holiday message:
   ``God in Christ has established forever a token of encouragement
to which all can turn who hunger and thirst for justice, a promise
of peace for all those who are peacemakers, and ... an objective
vision of all who struggle for justice, peace and the integrity of
creation.''

   The first Roman Catholic Mass from the Soviet
Union to be telecast in the United States will be carried Christmas
eve by VISN, the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network announces.
   Jeff Weber, program vice president for the cable system, says
the service from Vilnius Cathedral in Lithuania will be presented
at 9 p.m. EST Sunday, and repeated Christmas Day at 5 p.m.
   The Mass is to be celebrated by Archbishop Julionas
Steponovicius of Vilnius, believed to have been secretly made a
cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1979. He was allowed to resume his
church duties only a year ago.
   The 14th-century Vilnius Cathedral, known as the ``cradle of
Lithuanian Christianity,'' was seized by Soviet authorities in the
1950s and converted into a secular gallery, but was returned to the
church early this year.
   VISN is operated by a consortium of 22 faith groups _ Eastern
Orthodox, Jewish, Roman Catholic and Protestant.
