   The Nicaraguan military stationed two tanks
near the U.S. Embassy in Managua on Thursday after U.S. troops in
Panama City surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies, American
officials said.
   The officials said the turrets of the Nicaraguan tanks were
turned away from the Embassy, adding that there was no indication
hostile action was contemplated.
   U.S. troops were sent to the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in
Panama City after rumors spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
may have fled there during the U.S. military invasion.
   If the Nicaraguan tanks do nothing to disrupt embassy operations
in Managua , ``there is not anything we would want to do to
escalate'' the situation, said one official, who asked not to be
identified.
   Otherwise, the administration will give ``deep consideration''
on how to respond, he said.
   U.S. diplomats told Nicaraguan authorities they saw no reason
for the tank deployment, but the Nicaraguans said the deployment
was in response to U.S. activities in Panama.
   The Americans replied that no hostilities were planned against
the Sandinista embassy in Panama.
