   The dollar finished lower against major currencies
in Europe Thursday in light pre-holiday trading. Gold prices also
fell.
   Currency strategists said there was no underlying reason for the
dollar's behavior, though some U.S.-based strategists said talk of
lower interest rates in the United States may have played a role. A
drop in interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments
worth less.
   The U.S. invasion of Panama and unrest in Romania appeared to
have had little impact on the U.S. currency, money brokers said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6125 from $1.6052 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe vs. late Wednesday: 1.7250
West German marks, down from 1.7355; 1.5575 Swiss francs, down from
1.5585; 5.8955 French francs, down from 5.9165; 1.9560 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9720; 1,287.50 Italian lire, down from
1,288.00; 1.1605 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.46 yen to a closing 143.77 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.68 yen.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $412.75 a troy ounce
from 413.50 dollars bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the metal was unchanged at a bid $413. Gold in Hong
Kong fell 70 cents to close at a bid $411.34.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.57 a troy
ounce, vs. $5.56 late Wednesday.
