   A young, unemployed man was charged with
setting a fire that killed three people at a senior citizens
apartment complex, police said.
   George Ludlow Jr., 26, of Watertown was arrested late Friday,
and charged with three counts of second-degree murder, police said.
He was being held without bail.
   Jefferson County District Attorney Gary Miles said Ludlow
confessed to the crime during interviews with members of the joint
task force investigating the fire. Miles said Ludlow also signed a
confession.
   In addition to the three people who died, 71 were injured,
including three firefighters, in the Dec. 15 fire, which began in
the community room of the 16-story Mid-Town Towers apartment
building.
   The fire ripped through the first floor, and smoke filled the
complex's upper floors, forcing the evacuation of 151 residents in
the 60s, 70s and 80s.
   Miles refused to discuss the motive for the fire or allow police
to comment on it. ``I have a very strict policy: I don't discuss
evidence,'' Miles said.
   Police Chief Michael Hennegan said his department had no contact
with Ludlow before the arson investigation.
   ``He is unemployed and lives with his parents. He is a
functional illiterate,'' Hennegan said.
   The 23-member task force has put in more than 2,000 hours of
police work since the fire, the chief said.
   ``We had a number of leads simultaneously leading to this man,''
he said.
