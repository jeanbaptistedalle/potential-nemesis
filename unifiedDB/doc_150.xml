   Scientists looking into ways of boosting
milk production have discovered the sweet smell of success in anise
oil.
   Dairy cows got along better when sprayed with the
licorice-scented fragrance, and when cows feel at ease, they give
more milk, say researchers Keith Cummins and Lawrence Myers of
Auburn University.
   ``Most people seem to find a little bit of humor in it,''
Cummins said last week. ``I try to emphasize that this has a
serious application, but it makes me smile, too.''
   Cummins said dairy cows must be regrouped every two to four
weeks to maximize production and feed efficiency, forcing the
animals to re-establish their ``pecking order.'' That results in
biting, pushing and shoving. Cows become nervous and upset, and
milk production drops.
   The loss for a 500-cow dairy could amount to 500 to 700 pounds
of milk a month or more, Cummins said. ``At $14 per 100 pounds, it
adds up,'' he added.
   Anise spray reduces aggression among cows, Cummins said. As the
smell wears off _ usually about the third day _ the pecking order
is already being established.
   Does that mean cows like perfume?
   ``It wasn't because the sprayed cows smelled good,'' Cummins
said. ``What we did was make it so the cows couldn't tell one from
the other.''
   Cummins said research in animal behavior is becoming more
important because of the animal rights issue.
   ``Intensive farming methods are being challenged as to whether
they are humane or not,'' he said. ``So we have to do more research
to make these cows as happy and contented as possible.''
