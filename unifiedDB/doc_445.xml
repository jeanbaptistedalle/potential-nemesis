   Security measures were ordered stepped up
Tuesday at Greece's major airports, seaports, border posts and
other high-risk targets following recent reports on possible Middle
East terrorism.
   Public Order Minister Dimitris Manikas said the alert was a
joint decision made last week by the European Community's security
officials, and in reaction to the arrest of suspected Shiite Moslem
terrorists in Spain on Nov. 23.
   In addition, the U.S. State Department sent an advisory Dec. 15
to U.S. embassies expressing its concern that terrorists may be
planning near-term attacks against U.S. interests.
   The increased vigilance was ordered at Greece's airports,
frontier posts, seaports, embassies and airline offices.
   Manikas declined to disclose whether information had been
received advising of possible terrorist action in Greece.
   He said security at Athens International Airport, a hub for
Middle Eastern points, was already one of the tightest in the world.
   Terrorists have struck in Greece several times in the past 10
years. In the most recent incident in July 1988, nine people were
killed and 53 injured in a grenade attack aboard a Greek liner as
it sailed toward Athens. No one has ever been arrested in the
bloody incident but police suspect terrorists of Middle Eastern
origin were involved.
