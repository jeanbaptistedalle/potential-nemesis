   Hermann Julius Oberth, a pioneer
of the space age who worked with Werhner von Braun to help develop
Germany's V-2 rocket, died Friday. He was 95.
   Oberth died at a hospital in Nuremberg after a short illness,
according to a statement from the Hermann Oberth Museum in nearby
Feucht.
   He began experiments on a conical jet motor for the German
government in 1930 and developed a model later that year. He worked
on the motor with von Braun, considered the leading scientist in
U.S. space flight development.
   Oberth joined Braun in rocket experiments in the United States
in 1955, but he retired three years later and returned to live in
West Germany. Braun died in 1977.
   Oberth was born near Nuremberg on June 25, 1894. At age 15, he
built a small model of a rocket motor described in Jules Verne's
science fiction book ``From the Earth to the Moon.''
   After high school and World War I service in the German
infantry, Oberth studied medicine, aerodynamics and physics at
universities in Munich, Goettingen and Heidelberg.
   He submitted a thesis on rocket experiments for his doctorate,
which was turned down as too cursory. An expanded version was
published in 1923 as the book, ``The Rockets to the Planets in
Space.''
   A third publication of the work in 1929, ``The Way to Spaceship
Travel,'' is today seen as a pioneering work in rocket research.
   The same year, Oberth lost the sight in his left eye in an
experiment while working as an adviser to German director Fritz
Lang on his film, ``Woman on the Moon.''
   There were no immediate details about survivors or funeral
arrangements.
