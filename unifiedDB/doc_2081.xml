   The Vatican said today there is no legal way
its embassy in Panama can hand over Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to
U.S. authorities.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro also said the Vatican had not
discussed with any countries the possibility of arranging exile for
Noriega, who turned himself in to the Vatican Embassy in Panama
City on Sunday.
   Navarro told a news conference that Noriega took refuge after
the papal nuncio, or ambassador to Panama, agreed to let the ousted
dictator stay in the embassy. He arrived there five days after U.S.
troops invaded Panama in an effort to capture Noriega and restore
the elected government.
   Asked about U.S. demands that the embassy directly turn over
Noriega to U.S. authorities, Navarro said there was no legal way
that could be done. He said the embassy is empowered to deal only
with the government of Panama and no other foreign government.
   The Panamanian government has not made any request for Noriega,
Navarro added.
   He said the Vatican and the United States were working together
to find a legal solution satisfactory to both sides.
   ``We're dealing with a complex problem whose various elements
cannot be ignored. These elements include legal considerations,
diplomatic, humanitarian and therefore ethical ones,'' he said in a
statement.
   Asked about reports of hard feelings between the Vatican and the
United States, Navarro said, ``There has been no element at all
that could be called a situation of strain, tension,
misunderstanding.''
   He said meetings between U.S. and Vatican officials on the
Noriega case ``have taken place from the beginning in a clear and
very cordial climate.''
   The comments contrasted with reports from Washington, where a
State Department source said Monday that the United States had
demanded ``in extraordinarily tough terms'' that the Vatican turn
over Noriega to the United States, where he faces drug charges.
   Earlier this week, Navarro virtually ruled out the possibility
Noriega would simply be turned over to U.S. authorities as demanded
by the Bush administration.
   Vatican officials have said Noriega will probably be granted
exile in a third country.
   However, Navarro said the Vatican had not been in contact with
any countries about the possibility of offering Noriega exile and
said it was too soon to talk about that.
   Navarro said three other Panamanians arrived at the embassy
Sunday with Noriega. He identified them only as a military captain,
his wife, and another military official.
   He said the Holy See believes the matter can be resolved in
``days, not weeks'' but provided no evidence of progress in talks
on the fate of the deposed Panamanian strongman.
