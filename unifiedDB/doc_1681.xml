   Here is a brief summary of events Sunday in Romania:
   _The revolutionary government called for a cease-fire as
citizens and soldiers allied with them fought secret police loyal
to ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Sniper fire paralyzed
Bucharest and bodies piled up in morgues.
   _Vigilante groups plucked weapons from dead soldiers and sought
revenge against the fallen regime's supporters.
   _Four Western journalists, including Associated Press
correspondent John Daniszewski, were shot and wounded while
covering the fierce fighting in the western city of Timisoara.
   _Revolutionary soldiers found a vast labyrinth of safe houses
and tunnels used by police forces loyal to Ceausescu.
   _The United States and France said they would not oppose Soviet
bloc military intervention in Romania.
   _France also said it is willing to help muster a ``brigade of
volunteers'' if asked to aid the Romanian insurgency.
   _The International Red Cross led new efforts to send in food and
medical aid, but the fighting prevented most relief flights from
landing in Bucharest.
   _Romanians who long suffered religious oppression play Christmas
music throughout the country for the first time in 42 years.
