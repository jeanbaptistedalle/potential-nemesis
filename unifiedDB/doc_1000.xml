   A new charity to aid Third World countries was
launched Thursday in memory of the United Nations Commissioner for
Namibia who was killed in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing.
   The Bernt Carlsson Trust, named after the commissioner, was
launched on the first anniversary of the bombing. Carlsson, a
Swede, had been on his way to New York to sign a Namibian peace
settlement and was one of the 270 victims.
   Glenys Kinnock, wife of opposition Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock, said the charity would funds for Namibia, formerly South
African-controlled South-West Africa.
   ``Our aims are to have some memorial to Bernt Carlsson who spent
his life, dedicating his life to relieving poverty in the
developing world,'' said Mrs. Kinnock, who is heading the trust.
   Carlsson's brother, Tore, attended the launch of the charity.
   The trustees include rock star Peter Townsend of The Who.
