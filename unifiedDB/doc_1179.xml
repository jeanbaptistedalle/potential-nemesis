   Southmark Corp., one of the biggest companies to
seek bankruptcy-court protection because of a default on junk bond
debt, said Thursday lower property sales and higher interest costs
led to a $330.4 million quarterly loss.
   For the fiscal year, the real estate and financial services firm
lost $1.46 billion, due mainly a $962 million provision for losses.
   The company also said its San Jacinto Savings Association, a
thrift on which officials have based much of their recovery hopes,
was $21.2 million short of the required capital as of Sept. 30.
Southmark said it is negotiating with federal regulatory officials
over the future of San Jacinto, one of the largest thrifts in Texas.
   Southmark was one of the fastest-growing companies in Texas but
faltered badly because of an excessive reliance on debt,
particularly the use of financing with high-yield, high-risk junk
bonds.
   It went into technical default on $700 million in junk bond
obligations earlier this year and sought protection from creditors
in bankruptcy court in July.
   Southmark said the $330.4 million loss in the quarter ended June
30 amounted to $7.51 per share, compared with a $138.32 million
loss in the comparable period.
   Revenue in the quarter dropped from $539.75 million to $287.15
million.
   The fiscal year loss, which amounted to $33.16 per share,
compared with fiscal 1988's loss of $125.12 million, or $3.60 per
share.
   Revenues in the year declined form $1.86 billion to $1.79
billion.
   Southmark has said in bankruptcy filings that it had assets of
$866.5 million and debts of $1.51 billion.
