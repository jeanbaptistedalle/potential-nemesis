   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis
returned to Panama after a seven-month absence Wednesday and
declared that neighboring Latin American leaders would ``deep
down'' be pleased that U.S. troops ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   But he warned that life in Panama would remain dangerous as
Noriega loyalists retaliate.
   Davis left Panama the day after Noriega voided elections which
most observers say he lost to opposition candidates now installed
by the U.S. action. However, other Latin American countries have
sharply criticized the United States and have refused to accept the
new leadership in Panama so far.
   Davis said the position of those leaders was a reflection of
their many years supporting non-interventionist treatment of their
region. But he said privately they had to be pleased.
   ``I think that deep down that they're glad to get rid of this
man,'' he told a heavily guarded press conference at Howard Air
Base. Only a pool of reporters from Washington was allowed to
attend.
   He expressed concern that Noriega supporters would seek revenge.
   ``I think that this is a very difficult time for security
because of retaliation. There will be retaliation,'' Davis said.
   The returning ambassador said he was bringing an economic
recovery plan for discussion with Panama's new leaders, but made no
promise of U.S. aid except to point out that $700 million in assets
would be returned as a result of President Bush's decision to lift
economic sanctions.
