   A clandestine gunpowder factory
exploded in northeastern Brazil on Tuesday, killing four people,
injuring more than 100 and destroying nearby homes, a fire
department official said.
   Fire department workers dragged more than 100 people from the
wreckage of their homes after the 8 a.m. blast, said Sgt. Pedro
Oliveira Filho in an interview from the city of Feira de Santana,
960 miles northeast of Rio.
   Several of the more badly injured were hospitalized in critical
condition.
   The TV Globo network showed scenes of houses near the factory
reduced to rubble and trees flattened.
   ``When I heard the explosion I remembered God because I thought
everyone was dead,'' said a woman identified as Maria Jose, who was
injured in the blast.
   The factory, which had been operating for five months, had a
sign out front identifying it as an auto repair shop, Globo
reported.
