   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds fell $1.10 billion in the latest week to $366.01 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$210.0 million increase in the funds' assets the previous week, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. The rise originally
was reported as $208.2 million but the institute revised it upward.
   Fund assets hit a record high $368.23 billion in the week ended
Nov. 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds fell $523.8 million to $119.98
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds dropped $371.5 million to
$158.41 billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds declined
$208.1 million to $87.61 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.87 percent from 7.91 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.91 percent from 7.92 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, down from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.35 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.36 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.93
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.95
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.95 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.98 percent; 7.91 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.94
percent; and 7.92 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.95 percent.
