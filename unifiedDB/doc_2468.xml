   High school students are going ahead with
their New Year's Eve ``Lock-In,'' a drug- and alcohol-free party,
even though far fewer students have signed up this year than last.
   As at similar parties, the doors at Masuk High School's second
annual Lock-In will be kept shut so sober revelers can't go out and
get in trouble.
   ``Call me crazy, but I think being sober and watching the ball
drop is a lot more fun,'' said Lock-In Chairwoman Elizabeth Rhodes,
a junior.
   About 140 students had signed up to attend the party at the high
school, a smaller crowd than last year's 250, but enough to avoid
canceling the party, she said.
   ``We fell somewhat short, but psychologically, I can't cancel
out,'' she said.
   Students will ring in the new year with dancing, carnival games,
sports, contests, pizza and door prizes that include a color
television set.
