   More than 38,000 members of the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints are expected to participate in
dedication services for a new $18 million Mormon temple here.
   The dedication services, which will continue through Monday,
began Saturday with church president Ezra Taft Benson heading a
delegation that presided over the ceremonies.
   The 192-room Las Vegas temple is the church's 43rd operating
temple.
   Some 300 church members attended services in the temple's
Celestial Room Saturday, while another 3,100 members watched via 50
closed-circuit television monitors in rooms throughout the temple.
   Benson was accompanied by his church counselors, Gordon Hinckley
and Thomas Monson. Hinckley said Las Vegas Valley Mormons had
exceeded by 300 percent the amount of money they were asked to
contribute to the temple.
   An estimated 90,000 Mormons live in Nevada, nearly 10 percent of
the state's population.
