   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility said Wednesday that snow cover helped protect winter wheat
from the severe cold over much of the central and northern Great
Plains and the Corn Belt.
   ``Cold temperatures and lack of moisture stressed winter wheat
in Oklahoma and Texas,'' the report said. ``The extent of the
freeze damage was still unknown.''
   The report covered the week of Dec. 18-24 and noted that ``a
brutal blast of arctic air'' tumbled temperatures to record lows in
many areas.
   Below-normal readings in major citrus and vegetable areas of
Florida and Texas cause widespread damage, although losses have not
been fully determined, the report said.
   The facility is operated jointly by the department's of
Agriculture and Commerce. Weekly reports cover general crop
conditions but do not include production forecasts.
