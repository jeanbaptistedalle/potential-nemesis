   Gov. Rose Mofford slept well overnight and was in
stable condition today after being hospitalized with chest pains,
officials said.
   Preliminary tests after the 67-year-old governor was admitted to
St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center on Sunday indicated her
gallbladder was to blame.
   ``I believe they checked out the heart and chest complaints, and
they are of less worry,'' press assistant Vada Manager said Sunday
night.
   Manager said he was not aware of any previous problems Mrs.
Mofford had with her gallbladder. He said her pain eased after she
checked in.
