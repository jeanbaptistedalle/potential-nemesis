<HEAD>China To Amend Joint Venture Law</HEAD>

   China's legislature, in a bid to restore
confidence among businesses and investors, has proposed changing a
law governing joint ventures with foreign firms.
   The proposed amendments include guarantees that the government
will not nationalize or requisition joint ventures, the official
media reported Thursday.
   The changes also stipulate that partners in a joint venture may
choose the chairman and vice chairman of their operation. Under
current law, the chairman must come from the Chinese side of the
partnership.
   The new law would not require partners to set a specific time
for the length of their contract. Previously all joint ventures
were for fixed periods, often 20 or 30 years.
   Some 8,000 joint ventures have been established since China
opened its doors 10 years ago, and foreign investors have provided
about $14 billion for business ventures.
   Chinese leaders have been trying to convince potential investors
that the investment climate remains favorable despite the political
turmoil of the pro-democracy movement and a tough government
austerity program that has stopped implementation of new economic
reforms.
   Foreign businessmen are concerned that their independence will
be limited and that the current conservative atmosphere will mean
more political interference in their operations.
   The draft amendments to the joint venture law are being
discussed at an ongoing meeting of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee. They are expected to be passed when the NPC,
China's parliament, holds its annual session next spring.
