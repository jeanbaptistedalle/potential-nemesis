   London share prices rose in abbreviated trading
Friday, propelled by hearty yearend demand.
   Sentiment was helped by news that Britain's merchandise trade
deficit narrowed to a better-than-expected 1.52 billion pounds,
$2.4 billion, in November from 1.83 billion pounds, $2.9 billion,
the previous month.
   The government's report raised hopes that interest rates won't
be pushed higher. Higher opening prices in New York also boosted
London trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 23.9
points, or 1 percent, at 2,422.7 points, just below its peak of
2,422.8 points. At its lowest, the index opened at 2,399.1.
   Trading closed at 3:30 p.m. (1530 GMT), 90 minutes hours earlier
than normal, ahead of the four-day New Year's weekend.
   Volume amounted to 333.1 million shares, compared with 327.8
million shares which had changed hands by 3 p.m. Thursday.
