   About 10,000 Islamic fundamentalists
massed outside the National Assembly on Thursday to demonstrate for
the ``dignity of Islamic women.''
   The rally, attended by many women with their heads covered by
the traditional scarf, was intended as a reply to a recent
spontaneous demonstration of women at the site to protest Islamic
extremism and demand the strict application of Algeria's
Constitution calling for equality of the sexes.
   Loudspeakers broadcast verses from the Koran, the Moslem holy
book, without interruption, while orderlies arranged the lines of
demonstrators before the National Assembly as the police looked on
but took no action.
   Meanwhile, the National Assembly adopted a ban on political
demonstrtations at sites reserved for religious purposes.
   The fundamentalists who control most of the 8,000 Algerian
mosques have increasingly used their sermons to denounce the
``Westernization'' of Algerian society and the decline of strict
Islamic values.
