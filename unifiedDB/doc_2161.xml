   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army
recently put to death 17 of its senior officers and imprisoned 29
others, a ministerial source was quoted by the Sudan News Agency as
saying Wednesday.
   The new report said no explanation was offered for the orders
purportedly given by rebel leader John Garang.
   The agency quoted the source as saying the rebels imprisoned 29
officers ranging from captain to lieutenant colonel ``while at the
same time demanding that the government release political detainees
and observe human rights.''
   The military government jailed ousted Prime Minister Sadek
el-Mahdi and about 50 other senior political leaders after the
military took power in a coup June 30. It says they will be tried
for political and economic corruption.
   The ministerial source said that of the rebels' five-man
military council, only Garang and William Noun remained. He
identified the other three only as Karbino, Silvar Care and Arok
Toun, and said all were in jail.
   No immediate comment came from the rebels.
   The Christian and animist rebel army took up arms against the
Moslem majority government in the north in 1983. The rebels demand
more autonomy and a greater share in the country's economic wealth.
