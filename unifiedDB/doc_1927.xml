   Cuba on Tuesday requested an urgent
meeting of the U.N. Security Council to condemn Washington for
ordering troops to circle the Cuban Embassy in Panama during the
hunt for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   No meeting was scheduled during informal council consultations
Tuesday night, but the question could be considered again.
   Cuban Ambassador Oscar Oramas Oliva made the request in his
second letter in two days to Security Council President Enrique
Penalosa of Colombia. He said that people in the Cuban ambassador's
residence in Panama City and in the embassy were virtual prisoners.
   At least 25 children and 30 women were being prevented from
leaving, he said, calling the U.S. action a violation of
international law and infringement upon the rights of diplomatic
personnel.
   U.S. troops surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in
Panama City on Thursday after rumors surfaced that Noriega may be
hiding in one of the missions. Noriega turned himself in Sunday to
the Vatican mission in Panama City.
   Last week, the council met at the request of Nicaragua, which
sought to condemn the U.S. invasion of Panama. But the United
States, Britain and France on Saturday vetoed a resolution that
would have deplored the U.S. military action and demanded immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces.
