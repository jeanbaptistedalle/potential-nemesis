   HISTORY _ The country obtained full independence from the Turks
in 1878 and was proclaimed a kingdom in 1881.
   Romania was one of the victorious allies in World War I, but
after the war it was wracked by political violence. In 1940, Ion
Antonescu overthrew King Carol II and established a dictatorship
that was aligned with Germany in World War II. As the German Axis
foundered, King Michael was able to re-establish a monarchy in
1944, but occupying Soviet troops led to the proclamation of a
Communist republic in 1947.
   Nicolae Ceausescu, 71, took power in 1965 after the death of his
mentor, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. His 24 years of hard-line rule
ended with his ouster Friday.
