   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against major
foreign currencies in light trading in Europe.
   Gold prices also rose.
   The dollar got a lift early in the day on speculation that the
Bank of Japan will soon raise its key interest rate, now standing
at 3.75 percent.
   Those rumors, which were denied by Japanese authorities, and
profit-taking in the West German mark combined to lift the dollar,
market watchers said.
   The rumors of a Japanese rate hike helped rekindle sentiment
that an interest-rate rise will eventually be needed to shore up
the yen.
   But dealers said trading was calm.
   ``Let's face it, there's been no terrific drama today,'' said
one senior dealer. ``Trading has been extremely narrow with
virtually no range at all.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 Japanese yen to close at 143.80
yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 143.80 yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6005 from $1.6020 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7365 West German marks, up from 1.7245; 1.5615
Swiss francs, up from 1.5480; 5.9300 French francs, up from 5.8890;
1.9575 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9455; 1,291.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,289.25; and 1.1613 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1610.
   Gold prices rose in London to a late bid of $413.75 a troy ounce
from $409.25 late Monday and to $414.00 in Zurich from $408.50 late
Monday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.83 to $412.80 an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.57 a troy
ounce from $5.55 late Monday.
