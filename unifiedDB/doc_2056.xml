   Chevy Chase's ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation'' was the holiday weekend favorite, grossing $7 million in
ticket sales during the four-day period.
   Christmas and cold weather kept overall movie business down,
according to figures released Tuesday by Exhibitor Relations Inc.
But the year-end box office will still set an all-time record in
excess of $5 billion, Exhibitor Relations said.
   ``Christmas Vacation'' finished ahead of the new adventure movie
``Tango &amp; Cash,'' which pairs Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone
portray as cops who don't always see eye-to-eye. ``Tango &amp; Cash''
collected a cool $6.6 million.
   In third place with $5.5 million was the black comedy ``The War
of the Roses,'' featuring Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as
the feuding couple. In fourth was ``Back to the Future Part II,''
with Michael J. Fox, on revenues of $4.1 million.
   ``Always,'' director Steven Spielberg's remake of the 1943 film
``A Guy Named Joe,'' opened in fifth place with $3.7 million. In
sixth was the animated film ``The Little Mermaid,'' which made $3.3
million.
   In seventh was the ensemble tear-jerker ``Steel Magnolias,'' on
$2.6 million. ``Blaze,'' the chronicle of Louisiana Gov. Earl
Long's affair with young stripper Blaze Starr, landed in eighth
with $1.7 million and is the season's biggest flop.
   ``Family Business,'' starring Dustin Hoffman and Sean Connery,
finished ninth with $1.6 million. The baby comedy ``Look Who's
Talking,'' was 10th with $1.5 million.
   Director Oliver Stone's ``Born on the Fourth of July'' opened
strongly in limited release, collecting a per-screen average of
$39,964 for a total take of $172,021. The glib documentary ``Roger
&amp; Me'' made $84,232 for a good debut on four screens nationwide.
   ``The Music Box,'' however, didn't play well, netting just
$19,381 on three screens.
