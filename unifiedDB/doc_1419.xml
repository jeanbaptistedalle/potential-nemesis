   Johnnie Jacob Bailes of Macon, a regular
with the Grand Ole Opry in 1943, has died after an extended
illness. He was 71.
   Bailes, who died Saturday, was a member of the original Bailes
Brothers Singing Group formed in 1937. The group appeared regularly
on the Grand Ole Opry broadcasts from Nashville, Tenn., in 1943.
   ``Dust On the Bible,'' one of the Bailes Brothers' songs, is in
the Smithsonian Institution. In 1983, the group received a star on
the walkway of stars at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville.
   A native of St. Albans, W.Va., Bailes also was one of the
founders of the Louisiana Hayride radio show.
   He moved to Swainsboro in 1956 and worked at WJAT Radio and the
Peach State Jamboree. He later became general manager of WJAT, WBRO
in Waynesboro and WSNT in Sandersville.
   He is survived by his wife, Juanita Smith Bailes of Swainsboro;
two daughters; two stepdaughters; two sons; three brothers; and 13
grandchildren.
