   An exhibit of Panamanian toads at the
Columbus Zoo has been pulled in the wake of the U.S. attempt to
oust Gen. Manuel Noriega from power, the zoo's director says.
   A group of zoo animals were scheduled for an appearance
Wednesday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' as part of a Christmas
show, said Jack Hanna, zoo director. But the fighting in Panama
pre-empted coverage of the exhibit.
   Hanna, in response to the fighting, then ordered that the toads
be taken off exhibit.
   Hanna said zoo staff members had been preparing for the
television appearance since 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``ABC had brought in a satellite truck from Virginia, two
producers and a director from New York. Two cameras were ready to
roll,'' Hanna said.
   ``(Head curator) Don Winstel was standing out there with a camel
and her baby, two sheep, two goats, reindeer and a miniature
donkey,'' Hanna said.
   But the network said there would not ``be any Christmas animals
today because we're at war with Panama,'' Hanna said.
   ``I never did like that SOB Noriega; now I hate him.''
