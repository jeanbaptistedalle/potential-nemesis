   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _Supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega fired mortars and
attacked buildings near the U.S. Southern Command. The fighting
lasted about an hour. Sporadic fighting and sniper fire continued
in many areas of Panama City.
   _A Pentagon source said an additional 2,000 Army soldiers would
be flown to Panama to supplement the 24,000 already in the country.
   _Noriega loyalists tried to assassinate the Panamanian vice
president installed by the United States. He was not injured.
   _Several pro-Noriega bands surrendered in western Panama.
   _Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
until Noriega is captured he will be a ``guiding hand'' behind
resistance to the U.S. occupation.
   _American forces rescued a Smithsonian Institution research team
abducted by Noriega soldiers.
   _Looters ransacked stores for the third day. Refugees fleeing
the fighting took cover in soccer stadiums, churches and schools.
   _President Bush told Congress it was impossible to predict the
``scope and duration'' of the U.S. intervention.
   _The Organization of American States said in Washington it
``deeply deplored'' the invasion and called for withdrawal of
American forces.
   _Twenty-one American troops and two female dependents have been
killed, 202 wounded and two soldiers and one civilian are missing.
U.S. officials said 122 Panamanian soldiers were killed and 45
wounded. Hospital officials said they believed half the Panamanian
casualties were civilian.
