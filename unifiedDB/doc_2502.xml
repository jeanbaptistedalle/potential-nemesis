<HEAD>Benham Sworn In as First Black on Georgia's Highest Court</HEAD>

   A judge who grew up in a public housing project
fought back tears as he was sworn in as the first black to serve on
the Georgia Supreme Court.
   Robert Benham said his family ``knew this day would come. They
knew there was nothing we couldn't do and ... nothing that could
hold us down.''
   Benham, a Court of Appeals judge for 5{ years, was named to the
state's highest court earlier this month by Gov. Joe Frank Harris,
and was given the oath of office Thursday during ceremonies at the
Capitol.
   During an acceptance speech, he had to fight back tears when he
declared his joy that his parents not only lived to see the
ceremony, but were able to participate in it.
   He said his success showed that a person ``can be born like I
was, raised in public housing ... and rise to the statehouse on
Capitol Hill.''
   Benham, 43, succeeds Justice Thomas O. Marshall, who is retiring
at the end of this month.
   The appointment lasts only through November, when the court seat
will be up for election.
