   The leader of the National Farmers
Organization urged President Bush and congressional leaders Tuesday
to work with farmers to increase agricultural exports to Eastern
Europe.
   ``Food will assist Eastern bloc nations more than dollars and,
at the same time, help the U.S. agricultural economy,'' said DeVon
Woodland of Blackfoot, Idaho, a rancher and president of the
Iowa-based NFO.
   Woodland said studies indicate that countries that received
assistance under the U.S. Food for Peace program have become
friends of the United States and developed into trading partners.
The same cannot be said of countries receiving U.S. financial aid,
he said.
   ``Why dollar aid when people in the Eastern bloc countries have
no food available to buy? We are the richest and most abundant
agriculture country in the world. We should use this food to, or at
least a portion of it, for assistance to the hungry,'' Woodland
said in a statement released by NFO headquarters in Corning.
   The group represents more than 250,000 farm families and markets
farm commodities for its members.
   Woodland said food shipments to Eastern Europe would reduce
grain surpluses, and thereby push up the prices U.S. farmers
receive for their crops.
   He urged President Bush, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
and members of the House and Senate agriculture committees to
consider establishing a federal agriculture conference to help
increase exports of food to Eastern Europe.
