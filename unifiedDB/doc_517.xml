   A 72-year-old native of Byelorussia was granted
bail Tuesday pending trial on charges he murdered 490 people,
mostly Jews, during World War II.
   The Ontario Supreme Court ordered Michael Pawlowski, who has
lived in Canada for 38 years, to put up his modest brick bungalow
in Renfrew, Ontario, as security.
   Pawlowski was arrested Monday in Renfrew, about 60 miles west of
Ottawa, and charged with eight counts of murder _ four under
Criminal Code provisions dealing with war crimes and four with
crimes against humanity.
   He is accused of murdering 410 Jews and 80 non-Jewish Poles in
1942 in the Byelorussian republic of the Soviet Union _ 400 Jews in
the small village of Snov, 10 more who escaped the first killings,
and 80 Poles in the same region.
   No mention was made in the charges as to whether Pawlowski was
serving in a military unit at the time.
   Historians estimate that thousands of Jews died during the Nazi
occupation of Byelorussia from 1941-43, most of them victims of
special killing squads organized by the Germans or local
collaborators.
   Pawlowski, described as a horticulturist, came to Canada in 1951
and five years later became a Canadian citizen.
   Under federal legislation passed two years ago, Canadian
residents can be tried here for war crimes or crimes against
humanity committed elsewhere. Since 1987 the government has moved
against two other accused war criminals.
   The war crimes unit was set up after a royal commission
recommended urgent action against 20 suspects who came to Canada
after World War II.
   Defense lawyer Don Bayne indicated the case is not likely to
come to trial until next fall.
   Friends and neighbors of Pawlowski were shocked by the charges,
calling him a quiet and likable man who won prizes for his flowers
and the homegrown vegetables he sold at a local farmer's market.
   While being granted bail, he was ordered to report weekly to
police and to refrain from leaving the Renfrew-Ottawa area without
permission.
   Pawlowski married in 1968. He and his wife Maria have no
children.
