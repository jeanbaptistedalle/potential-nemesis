   British Broadcasting Corp. listeners have chosen
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as Man of the Year.
   Listeners who voted gave Gorbachev three times as many votes as
runner-up Sir Anthony Meyer, the British lawmaker who challenged
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for the Conservative Party
leadership.
   It was the second year Gorbachev has won the contest sponsored
by BBC Radio Four's ``Today'' public affairs program.
   Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, placed third in this
year's poll, down from second last year, the BBC said Saturday.
   The BBC does not disclose the number of votes cast for each
candidate. But it said Friday, when announcing Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher had been selected Woman of the Year, that she
also polled three votes in the Man of the Year contest.
