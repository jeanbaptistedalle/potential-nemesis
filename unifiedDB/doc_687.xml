<HEAD>Settlement Near in Onassis Dispute Over Martha's Vineyard Lot</HEAD>

   Jacqueline Onassis' dispute with the Wampanoag
Indians over a prime beach-front property that the Indians say
contain the graves of a chief and his wife may soon be resolved,
lawyers for both sides say.
   Wampanoag lore holds that Chief Moshup and his wife, Squant, are
buried on the disputed Martha's Vineyard land. Moshup, according to
the oral tradition, threw his children into the sea when he saw the
white man approaching.
   Mrs. Onassis bought a 17 percent interest in the Gay Head beach
property in 1980 from a Wampanoag family that has owned the
property since the state surveyed and divided up Gay Head in 1870.
   A hearing expected to settle the matter of the 264-foot stretch
of coastal property was set for Feb. 2, Onassis attorney Brian
Hurley said Tuesday.
   ``There have been negotiations but we're not quite there yet,''
he said. The beach is held in undivided interest by more than 25
individuals, including Mrs. Onassis. But since she purchased her
part of the beach, the widow of President Kennedy has fought the
matter in court. Her private 380-acre retreat surrounds the beach.
   Paul Sulla, a Boston attorney and Gay Head resident representing
the Indians, said a settlement was close. He declined to discuss
the terms.
   The Wampanoag are descendants of the island's first settlers.
   Mrs. Onassis bought the acreage for her home in the mid-1970s
and since then has brought a series of legal actions in an attempt
to clear the title on the adjoining land.
   In turn, the Wampanoag sued Mrs. Onassis to retain access to the
property.
