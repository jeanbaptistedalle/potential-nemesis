   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by a drop in the
soybean market that analysts attributed mainly to technical factors.
   Soybean prices have been in a downward trend since last week and
on Tuesday the contract for near-term delivery fell below $5.70 a
bushel for the first time since early November.
   Slight losses early in Wednesday's session triggered new
selling, and reports of beneficial rain in the soybean fields of
Brazil encouraged further sales of soybean futures.
   Wheat and oat futures also dropped but corn futures finished
narrowly mixed with support stemming from an unexpected overnight
sale of 180,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to Spain.
   At the close, wheat futures were \ cent to 3} cents lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.06\ a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to { cent higher with March at $2.38} a bushel; oats
were unchanged to } cent lower with March at $1.52\ a bushel;
soybeans were 1} cents to 4{ cents lower with January at $5.64 a
