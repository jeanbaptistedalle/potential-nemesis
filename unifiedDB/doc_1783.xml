   The U.S. Coast Guard says it will test
a new system for keeping track of oil tankers in Alaska's Prince
William Sound, site of the nation's worst oil spill.
   The system will utilize satellite signals and long-range aids to
navigation rather than radar, said Mike Sollosi, chief of vessel
traffic services in the Coast Guard's Washington, D.C.,
headquarters.
   ``It is a black box on a ship which takes an accurate position
(of the vessel) and transmits the information to a vessel tracking
system'' such as the vessel traffic center in Valdez, Sollosi said
in a statement issued last week.
   He said a satellite is a tool for tracking ``because it is not
affected by mountains, which is a problem in Alaska.''
   Tanker traffic in Prince William Sound has been monitored by
radar. But when the Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24, the Coast
Guard said the vessel was beyond the area normally scanned by the
Valdez radar. The ruptured tanker spilled 11 million gallons of
crude oil into the sound.
   After the skipper reported the tanker was aground, the Coast
Guard was able to find it on radar, but operators said reliability
of the radar was limited by weather.
   Sollosi said the new system will be evaluated for one year in
the sound and 22 other ports and waterways around the country. He
said vessel owners will be responsible for the cost of installing
the ``black boxes.''
