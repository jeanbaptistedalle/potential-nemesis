   Hospital Corp. of America has stopped a
plan to sell its psychiatric hospital division to the unit's
employees because financing could not be obtained, the company said.
   The sale of HCA Psychiatric Co. and its 53 hospitals was to have
been completed by the end of the year. No other offers are before
the company, said Victor L. Campbell, vice president of corporate
relations.
   The $1.23 billion sale was to have been financed through an
employee stock ownership plan, with HCA retaining a 10 percent to
30 percent stake in the new company.
   ``We've been working on this since the summer and there have
been a multitude of things that have taken place, primarily in the
financial markets,'' Campbell said Tuesday.
   ``The bond markets have weakened somewhat and a lot of
legislation related to ESOPs and original discount securities has
been passed,'' he said.
   James K. Don, president of HCA Psychiatric, has resigned and the
psychiatric units will become part of HCA's network of 78
medical-surgical hospitals in the United States, Campbell said.
   HCA is paying back a $1.3 billion loan used to finance a $3.6
billion management-led buyout of the company earlier this year. HCA
has already paid $260 million through the sales of various units.
