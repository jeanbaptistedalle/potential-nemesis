   Stock prices showed a modest loss today,
registering no strong reaction to the U.S. military action in
Panama.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.34 to 2,690.27
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 529 up, 699 down and
550 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 55.75 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said investors were cautiously watching the situation
in Panama, but apparently not viewing it as any cause to make big
changes in their strategies.
   They noted that the prospective economic effects of the
confrontation, if any, remained unclear.
   At the same time, brokers said, stock traders appeared to draw
only brief encouragement from an upward revision in the latest
government figures on economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 3.0 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
third quarter of the year, up from a previous estimate of 2.7
percent.
   But traders said projections remained gloomy for the results to
be posted in the fourth quarter and the early stages of 1990.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose [ to 40{;
International Business Machines dropped | to 94[; American Express
gained ] to 31], and McDonald's was down \ at 33\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .18 to 189.22. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .61 at 367.34.
