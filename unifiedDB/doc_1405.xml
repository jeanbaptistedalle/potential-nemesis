   The General Assembly on Friday unanimously
called for an end to driftnet fishing in the South Pacific in 1991
and a global ban on use of the huge nets a year later.
   The resolution, adopted by consensus, denounces driftnet fishing
as ``a highly indiscriminate and wasteful fishing method which is
widely considered to threaten the effective conservation of living
marine resources.''
   Driftnets stretch up to 30 miles, scooping up all fish and other
marine life. Dolphins, porpoises, sea birds and unwanted fish are
killed along with the desired catch.
   Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have made extensive use of the
nets in the Pacific Ocean to catch squid. More than 1,000 ships
from many nations, including France, Spain and Italy, use the nets
worldwide.
   The U.N. resolution recommends driftnet fishing be scaled down
immediately in the South Pacific and ended there by July 1, 1991.
It says a worldwide ban should go into effect on June 30, 1992.
   While not binding, the resolution will probably gain wide
compliance, diplomats say. Japan, considered the biggest user of
drift nets, has already announced it will stop.
   The ban, the resolution added, could be waived in a region
``should effective conservation and management measures be taken.''
   Small-scale use of driftnets in coastal waters would be
excluded. The resolution said such fishing is important to the
economies of developing countries.
