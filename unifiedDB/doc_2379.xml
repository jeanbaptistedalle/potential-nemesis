   A twin-engined plane crashed into the second
floor of a house Thursday, killing the pilot and his passenger,
authorities said.
   The pilot, Floyd E. Smith, 75, and Elwood Graham were testing
the Beech 60 aircraft in preparation for a flight Friday to Florida
when it crashed around noon into the home of Willard and Antoinette
Flatley, not far from Lake Erie.
   The Flatleys were not home when the plane crashed, heavily
damaging the second floor of the house.
   ``I looked up. I saw it was low and it was making a strange
noise,'' said Paul Petak, a neighbor. ``Then it looked like it was
upside down. And it straightened up and went right down.''
   Smith was the president and founder of Automation Devices Inc.
in Fairview, and Graham was a shop employee who had been with the
company for more than 20 years.
   The flight originated from Erie International Airport and was
scheduled to return there. Airport Director Rosemary Noble said the
pilot apparently radioed the tower shortly before noon about an
engine problem.
   The pilot's first report indicated one of the engines was going
on and off, Ms. Noble said. The second report mentioned trouble
with the second engine. The crash apparently occurred about 30
seconds later.
   The plane was owned by Automation Devices, which employs 44
people in the manufacture of vibratory feeders, devices that feed
parts onto production lines.
