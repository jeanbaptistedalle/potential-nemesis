   A newborn baby girl found abandoned in freezing
weather on Christmas Eve was recovering today from frostbite as
authorities searched for her mother.
   The baby, dubbed ``Christie Eve Noel'' by a pediatrician at
Loyola University Medical Center in suburban Maywood, was in good
condition, said nursing supervisor Barbara Nostz.
   ``If we in fact find the mother, she could be charged with child
abandonment,'' said Detective Dave Krebes of the Hillside Police
Department.
   The 6-pound, 3-ounce baby was found wrapped in a blanket Sunday
afternoon outside a vacant apartment in Hillside, just west of
Chicago, authorities said.
   Residents of other units in the complex apparently heard the
infant crying and notified local officials, said Loyola spokesman
Mike Maggio.
   Authorities were unsure how long the child had been outside in
the 12-degree weather. Her feet were red with frostbite when she
was admitted to the hospital, but were returning to a healthy shade
of pink, pediatric nurse Gale Goodfriend said Monday.
   ``I don't really understand how the mother could do this,'' Ms.
Goodfriend said. ``She's a real beautiful baby, and it's real nice
having her here. It's Christmas and we got a little gift.''
   ``She suffered some frostbite to her feet due to the cold, but
it's not serious,'' Maggio said. ``There will not be any
long-lasting problems for her.''
   The infant will be turned over to the state Department of
Children and Family Services while the search for her mother
continues, Krebes said.
