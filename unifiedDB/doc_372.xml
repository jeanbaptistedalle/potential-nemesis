   ConAgra Inc. said Monday its net income rose
12.8 percent for its second fiscal quarter, giving the diversified
food conglomerate record earnings for the period.
   The Omaha-based company reported a profit of $63.9 million, or
52 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 26, compared with
$56.8 million, or 47 cents per share, in the same period last year.
   ConAgra reported sales of $3.86 billion for the quarter, up 36
percent from sales of $2.84 billion in last year's second fiscal
quarter.
   For the first half of its fiscal year, net income was up 20
percent to $113.9 million, or 92 cents a share, from $95 million,
or 79 cents a share, last year, the company said. Net sales were
$7.87 billion, up 39 percent from $5.65 billion last year.
   Charles M. Harper, ConAgra's chairman and chief executive,
attributed the results to ``ConAgra's food chain balance.''
   ``As food industry conditions change, different ConAgra
businesses come to the fore,'' he said. ``Fiscal 1990 is a case in
point, and we continue to expect record earnings for the full
year.''
   He said there are many domestic and international opportunities
for the company.
   ``For example, the current political trends in Eastern Europe
hold considerable promise for a basic food company whose job is to
help feed people better,'' he said.
