   Soybean futures prices settled moderately lower
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in quiet, sporadic trading.
The grain markets finished mixed in the shortened pre-holiday
session.
   Analysts said the soybean complex was dominated by one large
trade house that was seeking to press the price for March delivery
below $5.88 a bushel, and by independent ``local'' traders who were
sellers in the soybean meal market.
   March soybeans finished at $5.85} a bushel.
   Wheat settled slightly lower but the corn and oat markets were
nearly unchanged in extremely quiet trading with many traders
absent because of the sub-zero weather in Chicago or the upcoming
holiday weekend.
   The markets will reopen on Tuesday.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 1{ cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March at $4.11} a bushel; corn futures were

\ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.54\ a bushel;
soybeans were 2\ cents to 3 cents lower with January at $5.72\ a
