   The National Safety Council estimates as many as
350 people may be killed in traffic accidents over the four-day New
Year's holiday, which begins this evening.
   In addition, the Chicago-based council predicts that some 12,000
to 16,000 people may suffer disabling injuries in accidents on the
nation's streets and highways.
   The council bases its estimates on data from previous years,
seasonal weather conditions and national driving safety trends. It
says 317 people died in car accidents during the New Year's holiday
weekend last year.
   The official counting period begins at 6 p.m. EST today and runs
though 11:59 p.m. Monday, closing at midnight in each time zone.
   Over this year's four-day Christmas holiday, 353 people died _
fewer than the 386 traffic fatalities reported in 1988. The safety
council had estimated that between 320 and 420 people would die
this year.
   The council said that alcohol _ a factor in more than half of
all traffic fatalities _ poses a particular threat during the New
Year's weekend, when many people attend holiday parties.
