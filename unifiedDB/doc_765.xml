   Vocalist Bobby Brown was nominated
Wednesday for American Music Awards in five categories and video
dance queen Paula Abdul and rapper Tone Loc were named four times
each.
   Nominees for the 17th annual entertainment awards were chosen by
record sales and by voting in a nationwide poll. They were
announced at a news conference at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
   Winners of the 27 awards, organized in six categories, will be
named during a three-hour special at the Shrine Auditorium in Los
Angeles. The show will be broadcast live Jan. 22 by ABC.
   The nominees were selected from year-end sales records monitored
by Cash Box, the music industry trade publication. Ballots with the
top artists' names were then sent to a sampling of 20,000
Americans, who voted on their favorites in each category.
   The nominees:
