   A strong earthquake off Guam shook the western
Pacific, the Hong Kong Observatory said Sunday. There were no
immediate reports of damage or injury.
   The observatory said the quake, which occurred Saturday,
registered 5.5 on the Richter scale.
   The quake's epicenter was 322 miles northeast of Guam, the
observatory said. Guam is one of the Marianas Islands about 1,500
miles east of the Philippines.
   There were no further details on the quake.
   The open-ended Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded
on seismographs. Each increase of one number means a tenfold
increase in magnitude.
   An earthquake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.
