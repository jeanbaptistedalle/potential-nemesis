   CBS today named Hollywood movie executive Jeff
Sagansky as president of its last-place entertainment division.
   Sagansky, the 37-year-old president of Tri-Star Pictures and a
former top programming executive at NBC, succeeds Kim LeMasters,
who resigned Nov. 30 after two seasons as CBS Entertainment
president.
   He will be the chief programmer for a once-dominant network that
has been third in prime time ratings for two consecutive seasons,
has had not hits since ``Murder, She Wrote'' in 1984, and is
expected to be third again when the this season ends.
   Sagansky already has been looking at CBS programming on an
unofficial basis.
   In a statement, CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer
said Sagansky ``has earned the respect and admiration of the
Hollywood entertainment community.''
   CBS had considered him for the job in 1987 before deciding on
the executive he now will succeed.
   Sagansky was wooed again after CBS unsuccessfully last week
tried to lure to its vacant job a top TV production team, Marcy
Carsey and Tom Werner, whose company makes NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
and ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Sagansky joined Tri-Star from NBC in 1985 and had been in his
current job there since March.
