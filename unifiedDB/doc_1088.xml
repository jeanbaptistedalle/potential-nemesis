   Hundreds of thousands of Islamic
fundamentalists, many of them women, gathered Thursday near the
National Assembly to demonstrate for ``the dignity of Islamic
women.''
   The rally was intended as a reply to a recent spontaneous
demonstration of women at the site to protest Islamic extremism and
demand the strict application of Algeria's Constitution calling for
equality of the sexes.
   Many of those at the peaceful gathering were women, with their
heads covered by traditional Islamic scarves. Islam is the official
religion of this North African country.
   About 10,000 demonstrators who rallied earlier were joined by
hundreds of thousands of others, strictly separated according to
gender. They blocked streets leading to the government building.
   Police looked on but no violence was reported. Loudspeakers
broadcast verses from the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Banners
praised Islamic law as the only moral guide and declared that women
should be honored to wear the hijab, the traditional scarf covering
head, neck and ears.
   It was the largest demonstration by women in Algeria since the
country gained independence from France in 1962.
   The National Assembly, meanwhile, adopted a ban on political
demonstrations at sites reserved for religious purposes.
   The fundamentalists, who control most of the 8,000 Algerian
mosques, have increasingly used their sermons to denounce the
``westernization'' of Algerian society and the decline of strict
Islamic values.
