   The Lincoln Park Zoo announced Thursday the birth
of a new lowland gorilla at its Great Ape House.
   The baby was born Wednesday to a gorilla named Kowali, who is
mated to Gino, said senior keeper Pat Sass.
   The sex of the yet-unnamed baby is still undetermined because
Kowali is guarding it closely, Ms. Sass said. ``It depends on when
we can get a good enough look,'' she said. ``Mother is very
protective.''
   The birth of the infant brings the lowland gorilla population at
the Great Ape House to 22, the majority of them born in captivity.
   Ms. Sass said it is the second baby for 11-year-old Kowali,
whose mother and grandmother were born in captivity, and the first
child sired by Gino, who will turn 9 on Saturday.
