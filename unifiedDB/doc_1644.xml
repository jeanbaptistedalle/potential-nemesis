   One Emergency Medical Service ambulance crew
declared a man dead and left, then a second crew was called and
found that the man was breathing.
   The first EMS crew was placed on administrative duty until an
investigation is completed, said EMS spokeswoman Lynn Schulman.
   The city agency got a call Saturday that James Manners, 65, had
suffered cardiac arrest, Schulman said.
   The EMS crew declared him dead and left, and a police officer,
following standard procedure, remained at the scene until a vehicle
from the morgue could pick up the body, she said.
   But Manners' roommate suspected that the man was not dead and
called EMS a second time, police Sgt. Mary Wrensen said.
   A second EMS team was sent. ``The guy was breathing when the
second crew got there,'' Schulman said. They took him to Lincoln
Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later, she said.
