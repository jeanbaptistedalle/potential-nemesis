   The National Bank of Poland is devaluing
the Polish zloty by 32 percent, Polish media reported Sunday, in
another step aimed at making the currency convertible and improving
trade prospects.
   Until now, the zloty could not be used for international
transactions because it is not convertible to other currencies.
   Polish radio said Sunday that the new official exchange rate set
by the bank will be 9,500 zlotys to $1 as of Monday. Banks and
exchange offices are closed on New Year's Day.
   It was the largest devaluation since Parliament approved the
non-Communist government in September. The zloty has been devalued
12 times since then.
   The government is supporting the effort to reduce the gap
between the official rate of the zloty and a legal, though
unofficial rate available to all citizens.
   On Saturday, the unofficial rate legalized earlier this year,
which reflects the former black market rate, hovered at about 9,000
zlotys to $1.
   The government previously announced it hoped the zloty would be
completely convertible by Monday, but Finance Ministry officials
explained last week that the unofficial rate will still exist.
However, the government intends to try to keep the gap between the
two rates to a minimum through bank intervention.
   Creation of covertibility of the zloty has been a centerpiece of
economic legislation passed by both houses of Parliament last week.
   The devaluation also occurs before major price hikes expected
Monday.
