   Britain's worst flu epidemic in 15 years claimed
at least 102 more lives this month, raising the death toll to 126,
according to government figures released Tuesday.
   Doctors estimate that more than 1 million Britons are suffering
from the English flu, a variant of Hong Kong flu that swept Britain
in the winter of 1974-75.
   The Royal Society of General Practitioners said infection levels
have reached epidemic levels.
   Most of the latest deaths, all recorded in the first week of
December, were of people over age 65, according to the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys that monitors flu deaths year-round.
   In Geneva, the World Health Organization said influenza was also
spreading through Continental Europe.
   Karin Esteves, of the WHO's Division of Communicable Diseases,
said the outbreak in Britain was not as serious as in the earlier
epidemic.
   ``But we don't think it has already peaked,'' she told The
Associated Press in the telephone interview.
   She said that in France, the disease is spreading rapidly from
Paris and into the South. Reports from Belgium, Switzerland and the
Soviet Union also suggest the flu outbreak is growing worse in
those places.
   She added that occasional vaccine shortages may occur because of
the high demand.
   Symptoms of the disease include fatigue, aching muscles,
headaches, coughing and prolonged fever lasting four or five days.
