   Sheriff's deputies collared a man
accused of taking his dog for a quick spin _ in a heavy-duty dryer.
   Kelly Gay, 32, was in custody Monday with bail set at $5,000
after he allegedly added the 5-year-old mixed terrier to a pile of
clothes to a dryer at a self-service laundry, dropped in his
quarters and turned it on, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt.
Terry Judge.
   Other customers rushed to the dryer, shut it off and called
sheriff's deputies. The male terrier was still in the dryer when
the deputies arrived, Judge said.
   ``They said it's cute as a button,'' Judge said. The terrier was
not seriously injured and given to the custody of animal control
workers, Judge said.
   Gay, who police described as a transient, was held for
investigation of animal cruelty.
