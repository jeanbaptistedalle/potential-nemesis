   Nicotine, the drug inhaled by cigarette smokers,
can help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, psychologists
reported Tuesday.
   ``Giving nicotine resulted in the patients becoming more alert,
responding more vigorously, and doing better on a variety of mental
tests,'' Reading University psychology professor David Warburton
told the London conference of the British Psychological Society.
   Research carried out at London University's Institute of
Psychiatry by Warburton's colleagues, Dr. Barbara Sahakian and
Gemma Jones, matched 39 Alzheimer's patients with a healthy group
of elderly people of the same age and intellectual ability.
   Compared with the effects of a placebo, nicotine helped the
patients suffering from premature senile dementia symptoms
associated with Alzheimer's to be more alert, the psychologists
said. However, they said nicotine did not improve their memories.
   Alzheimer's is a progressive disease characterized by
degeneration of the brain cells.
   Warburton said he would not prescribe cigarettes to his patients.
   ``My colleagues and I have never at any time recommended
patients smoke cigarettes,'' the psychologist said. ``We were
experimenting with safe ways of giving nicotine, for example
through a specially impregnated patch on the skin.''
   Warburton's report was one of 150 papers presented at the
two-day conference held at London University's Institute of
Education.
