   Sen. Alan Cranston will be married for
the third time in a Christmas Eve ceremony to a woman he met 21
years ago.
   Cranston, 75, plans a weekend wedding and a honeymoon in ``a
private spot in Northern California,'' he said after he and Cathy
Lee Pattiz obtained a marriage license on Monday.
   Cranston and Pattiz, 49, got the license at a county office in
Palo Alto. They will be married Christmas Eve at the home of
Cranston's sister in Los Altos Hills in a ceremony conducted by
U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham, a friend of the senator's.
   Cranston, whose second marriage ended in a divorce last May, has
served in the Senate since 1969. He first met Pattiz in 1968 during
his first senatorial campaign. The marriage will be her first.
   ``The proposal came as a complete surprise to me,'' said Pattiz.
   Cranston, a Democrat, says he will seek re-election in 1992 to a
fifth Senate term. His financial ties to Charles Keating Jr., who
owned the scandal-ridden Lincoln Savings and Loan, are sure to be a
campaign issue, but Cranston says he is confident he will prove he
did nothing improper in connection with the failed savings
institution.
