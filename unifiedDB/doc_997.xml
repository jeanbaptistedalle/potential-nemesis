   Elvis Presley's $100 million estate has
been turned over to his daughter and sole heir after more than a
decade of legal disputes, including a woman's claim to be The
King's illegitimate daughter.
   The estate will continue to be managed for Presley's daughter,
Lisa Marie, by a trust until 1998.
   Retired Probate Judge Joseph Evans returned to the bench briefly
Wednesday to sign the final order, which had been held up by a
young woman's claim as Presley's illegitimate daughter.
   Evans denied the claim in 1988 on grounds of insufficient
evidence, and appeals courts upheld the decision.
   Presley, ``the king of rock 'n' roll,'' died at his Graceland
mansion in Memphis in 1977. His estate has been managed in trust
for Miss Presley, who turns 22 in February.
   Miss Presley would have taken sole control of the estate at 25,
according to her father's will, but last year she agreed to extend
the trust until 1998. Miss Presley's mother, Priscilla Presley, was
divorced from her father when he died.
   The estate was valued at $5 million to $7 million at Presley's
death. The trust opened Presley's mansion to tourists in 1982, and
the estate also draws royalties from his recordings and controls
use of his name and image.
