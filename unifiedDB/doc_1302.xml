   Two men face life in prison for
fatally beating a 25-year-old man during an arugument that began
over the victim playing his radio too loud.
   Alex Abdalla Sr., 47, and Juan Rosado, 19, must serve at least
30 years before they can be eligible for parole.
   During sentencing Thursday, Superior Court Judge Barnett Hoffman
said the pair acted like ``a bunch of jackals attacking a
carcass.'' Hoffman said they beat and kicked Mario Santos, 25,
although he lay unconscious on the ground.
   Abdalla and Rosado were convicted Oct. 6 of beating Santos in
the parking lot of a New Brunswick housing complex during a dispute
that began when Abdalla told Santos to turn down the volume of
radio, said Middlesex County Assistant Prosecutor William Fetky.
   The two men argued and Santos was hit repeatedly by Abdalla, and
Alex Abdalla Jr., 17, who joined his father, Fetky said.
   As Santos was leaving, Rosado kicked him in the face and Abdalla
Sr. beat him with a metal spring while he lay unconscious on the
ground, Fetky said.
   Abdalla Jr., who was 16 at the time of the August 1988 beating,
pleaded guilty to juvenile delinquency in the case. He was
sentenced Oct. 12 and is serving up to four years in juvenile
custody.
