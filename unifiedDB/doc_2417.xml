   Lord Drogheda, who helped create the modern
Financial Times, Britain's business daily, died on Dec. 24 at age
79.
   An obituary in the newspaper on Thursday said: ``He combined a
vision of excellence with a relentless attention to detail and a
refusal to be satisfied with anything less than the highest
standards.''
   Drogheda and his editor Sir Gordon Newton built the Financial
Times in the 1950s from a newspaper of small circulation for
London's City financial district into a daily journal read
throughout the world. The newspaper is renowned for the accuracy,
impartiality and scope of its worldwide business and political
coverage and it also has a closely read arts section.
   The Financial Times was founded in 1888 and now sells around
300,000 copies daily, including an international edition printed in
Frankfurt, New York and Paris.
   Drogheda, who was Charles Garrett Ponsonby Moore before he
inherited the 300-year-old earldom in 1957, came from Anglo-Irish
stock and sold advertising space on the Financial Times in the
1930s. He became managing director in the 1940s, chairman in 1971
and retired in 1975.
   Drogheda, pronounced Droyeda, had been chairman of the Royal
Opera House, Covent Garden, and a director of the Royal Ballet.
   His wife, concert pianist Joan Carr, died eight days before him.
They had one son.
