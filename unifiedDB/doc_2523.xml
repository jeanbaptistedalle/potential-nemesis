   The Agriculture Department announced today
that the federal price support for milk produced by farmers will be
reduced Jan. 1 to $10.10 per 100 pounds, a 50-cent cut from the
current level.
   Acting Secretary Roland R. Vautour said the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1989 authorized a reduction of up to 50 cents
_ the maximum announced today _ if government purchases of surplus
dairy products are expected to exceed five billion pounds of milk
equivalent in 1990.
   If the support had remained at $10.60 per hundredweight, 1990
purchases by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. would have
totaled an estimated eight billion pounds, he said. With the
reduction to $10.10, purchases are expected to be 7.4 billion
pounds.
   Unlike price support operations for many other commodities, the
dairy program does not give farmers direct federal payments.
Instead, the CCC buys surplus cheese, not-fat dry milk and butter
so that processors and handlers can pay dairy farmers at least the
basic support rate for milk.
   The CCC purchase price of butter will be reduced 11.25 cents per
pound to $1.0925 per pound, the announcement said. Non-fat dry milk
will be unchanged at 79 cents per pound. The price of block cheddar
and barrel cheese will be reduced by 4.5 cents per pound to $1.11
and $1.07 per pound, respectively.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who is on vacation, had
been urged by the National Milk Producers Federation not to reduce
the 1990 milk support rate, contending that such a move would
``prove seriously destabilizing to the dairy industry.''
