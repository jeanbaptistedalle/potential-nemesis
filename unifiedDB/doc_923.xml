   A judge on Wednesday refused to dismiss charges
that the president of Rite Aid Inc. tried to bribe an Ohio State
Pharmacy Board member to resign.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian J. Greene set a
tentative trial date of Jan. 15 for Martin L. Grass, who heads the
nation's largest drugstore chain.
   Grass, 35, and his attorneys appeared in court Friday to ask
Greene to drop the charges.
   Grass has denied government charges that he and Rite Aid, based
in Shiresmantown, Pa., were trying to get members onto the pharmacy
board who would ensure the company's interests.
   A secret Cuyahoga County grand jury indictment was unsealed Aug.
1, accusing Grass and Rite Aid of offering a $33,000 bribe to
Melvin Wilczynski, a member of the State Board of Pharmacy.
Prosecutors contend the money was to be in exchange for
Wilczynski's stepping down from the board.
   Rite Aid has maintained that it paid Wilczynski $33,249 for a
legal buyout of his consulting contract with Lane Drug Co., a
division of Peoples Drug Stores Inc. Rite Aid acquired Peoples Drug
in April.
