   Two suspected members of an obscure
terrorist group shot and killed a policeman as he left for work in
this northeastern city, then sped away on a motorcycle, police said.
   Officer Juan Jose Sucino Ibanez was starting his van outside his
home in the working-class neighborhood of El Prat de Llobregat when
a man and a woman smashed the window and opened fire, police said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
the shooting was similar to others committed this month by the
tiny, extreme-left terrorist group GRAPO, which in Spanish stands
for the October First Revolutionary Anti-Fascist Group. Two
officers were seriously wounded in those shootings in Madrid and
Valencia.
   The group first became known and took its name from the date in
1975 when four Madrid police officers were murdered, an action it
later claimed. Police estimate the group has 10 active members.
