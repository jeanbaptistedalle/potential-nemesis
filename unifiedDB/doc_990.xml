   The whereabouts of a CBS News producer who was
seized with an ABC colleague by gunmen in Panama were unknown
today, CBS said.
   ``Our efforts to find him have not stopped and will not stop
until we can bring him back safely,'' CBS spokesman Tom Goodman
said of Jon Meyersohn.
   The ABC producer, Robert Campos, 31, was freed Wednesday, nearly
six hours after he was abducted. He told reporters he had been held
in a Panamanian army intelligence headquarters where he was
``threatened, constantly.''
   He and Meyersohn were among the journalists in Panama covering
Wednesday's U.S. military strike there against Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   They were in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Panama City on
Wednesday morning, discussing plans to send tape footage by
satellite, when a group of armed men took them away, an ABC
spokeswoman said.
   Meyersohn, 33, is a New York-based producer for the ``CBS
Evening News.''
