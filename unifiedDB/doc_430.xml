   A spectacular fire fed by oil-soaked
wood floors burned a converted 126-year-old mill complex today in
the biggest blaze in Providence history, officials said. Three
firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   Up to 150 firefighters _ every one in the city and some from
Rhode Island and Massachusetts _ battled the blaze in 17-degree
weather. The fire gutted six of nine buildings in the complex,
which had been converted to shops and other businesses.
   Fire Chief Michael F. Moise said it was ``the most extensive
area of fire that we've ever seen in the city of Providence.''
   The fire was declared under control about 1:30 a.m., eight hours
after it began, but Moise said it could take three days to douse
the hot spots at the complex of two- and four-story brick buildings
spread over a quarter-mile.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   ``The floors were pretty well-oiled,'' said Fire Department
spokesman Larry Donahue. ``They had machines that sat on those
floors for years, and they were oiled every day over a period of
100 years or so. That makes them more flammable.''
