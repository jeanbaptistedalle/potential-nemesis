   The editorial ``Is There a Santa Claus?'' first appeared in The
New York Sun, Sept. 21, 1897. It was written by Francis Pharcellus
Church, an assistant to the editor of The Sun.
   ``We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the
   communication below, expressing at the same time our great
gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the
friends of The Sun:
   `Dear Editor:
   I am 8 years old.
   Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus.
   Papa says `If you see it in The Sun it's so.'
   Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?
   Virginia O'Hanlon
   115 West 95th Street'
   Virginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected
by the skepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except
they see. They think that nothing can be which is not
comprehensible by their little minds. All minds, Virginia, whether
they be men's or children's are little. In this great universe of
ours man is a mere insect, an ant, in his intellect, as compared
with the boundless world about him, as measured by the intelligence
capable of grasping the whole of truth and knowledge.
   Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as
love and generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they
abound and give to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas! how
dreary would be the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be
as dreary as if there were no Virginias. There would be no
childlike faith then, no poetry, no romance to make tolerable this
existence. We should have no enjoyment, except in sense and sight.
The eternal light with which childhood fills the world would be
extinguished.
   Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in
fairies! You might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the
Chimneys on Christmas eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they
did not see Santa Claus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody
sees Santa Claus, but that is no sign that there is no Santa Claus.
The most real things in the world are those that neither children
nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of
course not, but that's no proof that they are not there. Nobody can
conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable
in the world.
   You tear apart the baby's rattle and see what makes the noise
inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the
strongest man, not even the united strength of all the strongest
men that ever lived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry,
love, romance, can push aside that curtain and view and picture the
supernal beauty and glory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in
all this world there is nothing else real and abiding.
   No Santa Claus! Thank God he lives, and he lives forever. A
thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand
years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of
childhood.''
