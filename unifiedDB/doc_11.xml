   Brooke Michele Ward, the first bone marrow
recipient to be matched with a donor through a national registry,
died in her father's arms exactly two years after receiving the
transplant in Seattle. She was 8.
   The girl died on the way to Rex Hospital in Raleigh, said her
parents, Marguriete and Michael Ward.
   Mrs. Ward said the leukemia prognosis had been good, but Brooke
continued to be afflicted with graft vs. host disease, a condition
in which the transplanted marrow is rejected by the body.
   Randy Hedgepeth, the girl's doctor, said that problem caused her
death.
   ``They were really encouraged with Brooke since she had made it
two years and had not relapsed,'' Mrs. Ward said. ``It looked like
just a matter of time and her body would accept the bone marrow.''
   Her operation Dec. 16, 1987, at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle was the first transplant in which marrow
was located from the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry.
   The girl's struggle brought recognition to the program, with the
registry growing from 23,000 potential donors to 40,000 in the
succeeding six months.
   Brooke met her donor, Diane Walters, 50, of Milwaukee in March,
moments before they appeared live on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning
America.'' They had become friends through letters and telephone
calls.
   Brooke is survived by her parents; brothers Jeffrey Michael Ward
of Pembroke Pines, Fla., and Jerry Lee Ward of Raleigh; maternal
grandfather, C.E. Wheeler of Raleigh; and paternal grandfather,
L.A. Ward of Everette, Wash.
   Funeral services were scheduled Monday in Raleigh.
