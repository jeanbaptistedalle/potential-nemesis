   Final payments totaling about $113 million are
going out to states as their share of national forest sales
receipts this year, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the money
was in addition to a preliminary payment of $248 million that went
to the states Sept. 28, bringing the total for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 to about $362 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Forest
Service for the sale of timber and other use of national forest
resources must be returned to the states where the forests are
located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1989 totaled approximately $1.44
billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.
   Oregon is the biggest recipient of total forest receipts for
1989 with $164 million, followed by Calfornia with $67 million and
Washington with $47 million.
