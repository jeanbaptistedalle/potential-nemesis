<HEAD>House Members Call For Sharing Burden Of Asian Defense</HEAD>

   Four House members called on the Bush
administration Tuesday to encourage U.S. allies in Asia to share
more of the defense burden and suggested channeling the savings to
developing nations in the area.
   ``As the Koreans and Japanese pick up more of the U.S. costs,
some of this money can be put to work nurturing our alliances
elsewhere,'' said Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas. ``Access and
influence are the name of the game in the Pacific and we can use
all of the friends we can find.''
   He said military assistance to Thailand, which hosted more than
100 U.S. Navy ships last year, has bottomed out.
   Leath, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and three
other colleagues on the panel _ Reps. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y.,
Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, and H. Martin Lancaster, D-N.C. _
traveled to the Pacific region Dec. 5-16 to assess national
security interests.
   In a report the lawmakers noted that the cost of maintaining
U.S. forces in Asia has increased sharply. South Korea has been the
source of a major increase due to a pay hike for the Korean work
force.
   ``Sometimes I wonder if we are more interested in providing for
their social security or our national security,'' Leath said.
``Money's tight and getting tighter, and we no longer can affort to
be the benevolent Uncle Sam.''
   Martin, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services
subcommittee on military installations and facilities, said Japan
has ``accelerated their contributions to the U.S. presence both in
terms of salaries for Japanese employees and facilities.''
