   The Bush administration carried out secret
contacts with a lawyer for Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
recently as last month in hope of persuading Noriega to step down,
the State Department said Wednesday.
   The contacts were disclosed in a State Department fact sheet
outlining U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve Panama's political
crisis.
   The lawyer, who was not identified, told Bush administration
officials in October he was authorized to discuss Noriega's
departure. After the U.S. officials ask for a specific proposal,
the attorney promised to consult with Noriega and return in a week.
   But, last month, Noriega's lawyer advised the U.S. officials
that he had been unsuccessful in obtaining any flexibility from
Noriega and said he was under instructions to have no further
contacts with the administration, according to the fact sheet.
   In early 1988, after Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking
charges, the State Department had attempted to negotiate his
departure from Panama but he suspended the talks at the last moment
just when it seemed an agreement was within reach.
   That proposal called for Noriega to leave Panama in August 1988
and for steps toward the restoration of democratic rule.
