<HEAD>Riot Charges Overturned on Three Racial Attack Defendants</HEAD>

   Misdemeanor riot convictions against three
teen-agers in connection with the Howard Beach racial attack, in
which a black man was killed, have been overturned on appeal.
   The three-page decision by a panel of Brooklyn Appellate
Division judges on the three defendants convicted in 1988 was
handed down Dec. 11 and reported in today's New York Post.
   Three other youths were convicted in a separate trial of
manslaughter and assault in the fatal racial attack.
   The case involved an attack on Dec. 20, 1986, by a group of
white males on several blacks, one of whom, Michael Griffith, was
chased onto a busy highway, where he was hit by a car and killed.
   The defendants, William Bollander, Thomas Farino and James
Povinelli, were sentenced in September 1988 to 34 days in jail to
be served on weekends over a four-month period. They were acquitted
of a more serious felony riot charge.
   Under the ruling, the indictments and convictions of the three
are thrown out. Prosecutors can resubmit the case to a grand jury
or drop the charges.
   A lawyer for the three defendants, Spiros A. Tsimbinos, said
today he had not yet seen the ruling.
   The appellate judges reversed the conviction because of errors
in the verdict sheets provided to the jury and because the trial
judge, Justice Thomas Demakos, failed to give the panel the option
of finding the three guilty of disorderly conduct, which carries a
maximum sentence of 15 days.
