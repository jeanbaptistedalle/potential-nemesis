   Five cars carrying people back
from voting in the presidential election plunged into a
30-foot-deep crater caused by heavy rains, and 15 people were
killed, a civil defense official said Monday.
   The cars dropped one after another into the hole after the road
crumbled near Santa Barbara, a city 1,200 miles northeast of Rio di
Janeiro, said Gloria Pires da Silva.
   She said the cars were returning from Salvador, 85 miles south
of the city, where all had voted in Sunday's presidential election.
   The lone survivor later said in a television interview that she
had escaped through a car window.
   In another incident, seven people were killed and 12 injured
Monday in Sao Paulo when a gas leak in a restaurant kitchen caused
an enormous explosion, a fire department official said.
   The blast destroyed the building and shattered windows in
neighboring buildings, said Capt. Flavio Umbardi.
