   A judge Monday sentenced 120
rebel soldiers to prison terms ranging from 3 to 10 years for their
role in a failed attempt to topple the government of one of South
Africa's black homelands.
   The group leader, Warrant Officer Timothy Phiri, and 21 other
rebel soldiers were to be sentenced Tuesday.
   The homeland's Supreme Court in Mmabatho convicted all 142
defendants in October of treason or terrorism for their roles in
the February 1988 coup attempt in Bophuthatswana.
   It is one of four tribal homelands that has been declared
independent by South Africa. No foreign government recognizes
Bophuthatswana.
   The coup was quashed by South African commandos, who freed
homeland president Lucas Mangope from captivity at a soccer stadium
and arrested the rebels, all members of the homeland's army.
   The Bophuthatswana News Agency said 92 of those sentenced Monday
received 7-year or 8-year prison terms.
