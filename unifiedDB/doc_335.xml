   Wedding bells are all right, but those who get married in the
Oklahoma County Courthouse in Oklahoma City can no longer celebrate
with rice or birdseed.
   Oklahoma County Commissioners have voted to ban the throwing of
rice, birdseed, confetti and other similar substances in and around
the courthouse.
   Rice and birdseed traditionally have been tossed at weddings as
symbols of fertility, but the commissioners' action apparently was
not an effort to limit population growth.
   Commissioner F.G. ``Buck'' Buchanan says the policy was enacted
as a safety measure. ``We've had people who have been hurt by
sliding on rice and so forth.'' _
   A French designer has created a wedding dress valued at $7.3
million, requiring a squad of guards at its modeling in Paris.
   Designed and made by couturier Helene Gainsville for her 1990
bridal collection, the lace gown is embroidered with 723 white
diamonds.
   Alexandre Reza of Place Vendome selected the jewels for the
dress, which took more than 3,000 hours to create.
