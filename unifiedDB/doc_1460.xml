   The stock market advanced slightly in quiet
preholiday trading today, aided what analysts described as yearend
``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.90 to 2,696.03 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 778 up, 497
down and 518 unchanged.
   Traders appeared to be shopping warily among recently depressed
stocks, hoping that the market will gather strength after the
pressure of tax selling is lifted with the arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Caterpillar dropped 1} to 55~ on top of a 1~-point loss
Thursday, when the company reduced its earnings projection for the
fourth quarter.
   Campbell Soup fell 4 to 52}. Recent takeover speculation about
the stock faded a bit after a statement late Wednesday by three
members of the company's controlling Dorrance family that they were
committed to keeping it independent.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, up 1| at 75|;
International Business Machines, up \ at 95], and American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up 1 at 44{.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.61 to 191.11. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .25 at 369.80.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 63.94 million shares at
noontime, down from 86.55 million at the same point Thursday.
