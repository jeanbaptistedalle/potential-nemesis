   The stock market worked its way higher in quiet
preholiday trading Friday, aided what analysts described as yearend
``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 20.26 to
2,711.39, cutting its loss for the week to 28.16 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,011 up, 488 down and 440 unchanged.
   Traders appeared to be doing some last-minute shopping among
recently depressed stocks, hoping that the market would gather
strength after the pressure of tax selling is lifted with the
arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Regional telephone stocks were standout gainers, following word
that the Federal Communications Commission plans to regulate local
phone companies on the basis of price rather than profits under a
plan to take effect Jan. 1, 1991.
   Bell South gained 2[ to 57~; Pacific Telesis ~ to 49; Nynex 3 to
91}; Southwestern Bell 1} to 62{, and U.S. West 1~ to 78}.
   Some closed-end investment companies specializing in single
countries also chalked up gains on news of the government's fall in
Romania, giving fresh impetus to the recent democratic ascendancy
in Eastern Europe. Germany Fund rose 1 to 13} and Austria Fund was
up 1} at 15{.
   Elsewhere, Caterpillar dropped 2 to 55| on top of a 1~-point
loss Thursday, when the company reduced its earnings projection for
the fourth quarter.
   Campbell Soup fell 3} to 53. Recent takeover speculation about
the stock faded after a statement late Wednesday by three members
of the company's controlling Dorrance family that they were
committed to keeping it independent.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 120.98 million
shares, down from 175.15 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 147.50 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $25.38 billion, or
0.76 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.45 to 191.95.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.54 to 396.35, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.64 at 347.42.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market added
3.48 to 444.57. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 370.84, up 1.29.
