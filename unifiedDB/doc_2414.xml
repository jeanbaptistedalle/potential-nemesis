   Uncertaintity about the prospects for Sears,
Roebuck and Co.'s new retailing strategy has led Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.
to lower its rating on Sears' fixed-income securities, the credit
rating agency said.
   Duff &amp; Phelps said in announcing the downgrade on Wednesday that
the move reflected the ``increased risks and earnings volatility''
of Sears' retail operations after the nation's largest retailer
switched last spring to a strategy of ``everyday low pricing.''
   The strategy, designed to win back market share from discount
retailers, involves offering more name-brand goods, lower prices
and fewer sales than in the past.
   Some retail analysts believe the strategy is failing, but Sears
says it is committed to the strategy and is still in the process of
converting its stores to the format.
   Sears' advertising of ``everyday low prices'' was attacked last
week by the attorney general of New York, who claimed in a lawsuit
that the prices at Sears stores are actually as high or higher than
before the strategy shift.
   Sears has denied the charge, which it contends is based on
comparisons of only 14 of the more than 100,000 items it sells.
   Duff &amp; Phelps downgraded Sears' senior debt, acceptance senior
debt and Discover Card credit senior debt Wednesday to AA-minus
from AA.
   At the same time, however, Duff &amp; Phelps reaffirmed the
commercial paper rating of all three entities at Duff 1-plus.
   The downgrading affects about $2 billion of debt securities.
