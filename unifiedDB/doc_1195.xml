   Chemical products giant ICI PLC
announced Thursday it has agreed to buy Tyler Corp.'s Atlas Powder
Co. to strengthen its position in commercial explosives and
detonator products businesses.
   The agreement is valued at $193 million with ICI assuming $58
million in debts and paying $135 million to Tyler shareholders. The
deal is expected to be completed in early 1990.
   Atlas is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Dallas-based Tyler.
ICI is based in London. Its American operation is ICI Americas,
headquartered in Wilmington.
   ``The United States is the world's largest commercial explosives
market and this acquisition will significantly enhance the
geographical coverage of ICI's international explosives business
and provide additional product opportunities arising from the
introduction of ICI technology into the U.S. marketplace,'' said
Bob Clark, a top executive of ICI explosives.
   ICI's explosives business has been based in Toronto since 1988.
Last year, the business had sales of $655 million. The business
employs about 8,000 people worldwide.
   Atlas, founded in 1912, manufactures and sells commercial
explosives and detonator products almost exclusively in the United
States. Atlas operates in 35 states and employs about 1,500 people.
It had sales of $198 million in 1988.
