   Gov. Mario Cuomo has named a task force to
help New York companies learn to make butter instead of guns.
   Cuomo created the task force Thursday to help New York companies
that lose defense contracts ``make a successful transition into
commercial production.''
   Noting that ``defense spending is a $20 billion industry in New
York state,'' Cuomo said the state had to be ready for change,
given Defense Secretary Richard Cheney's plan to cut military
spending.
   Cheney is considering cuts in the armed forces and cancellation
of weapons programs as part of an effort to reduce the defense
budget. Last month, Cheney directed the services to come up with
from $140 billion to $180 billion in cuts from the fiscal 1992 to
1994 military budgets.
   Cuomo said the task force would be headed by Vincent Tese, the
state's economic development director, and Brad Johnson, the
governor's Washington lobbyist.
   At the same time, the Democratic governor warned that the nation
must maintain its ability to produce weapons.
   ``If events in the Soviet Union or in Eastern Europe were to
take a dramatically different turn, we must be able to respond,''
he said. ``I am concerned about the erosion of our industrial base
in this country at a time when the Pentagon is awarding $10 billion
in contracts to overseas bidders.''
