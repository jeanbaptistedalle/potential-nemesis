   Pope John Paul II today expressed ``deep
pain'' over reports of killings in Romania and said he deplored
every act of violence against defenseless citizens.
   In making his first public statement on the violence in Romania,
the pope said he was praying so that fundamental human rights and
religious liberty were guaranteed in the country.
   ``With deep pain we have all heard the news of dead and wounded
in some Romanian cities,'' the pope said at the end of his weekly
general audience.
   John Paul said he was praying for the souls of the victims and
wanted to express words of comfort ``for the wounded and for all
the families that are in anguish because of this tragic event.''
   ``God bless Romania,'' the pope said.
