   A moderate earthquake rattled this desert
town. No major damage or injuries were reported, authorities said.
   The quake struck at 10:27 p.m. Sunday and measured 4.2 on the
Richter scale, said Robert Finn, a spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   It was centered nine miles east-northeast of Indio, a community
125 miles east of Los Angeles.
   ``We had several calls from people inquiring if this was an
earthquake, but we haven't had any reports of damage or injury or
anything like that,'' said Kathleen Murray, a police dispatcher.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause
slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable
damage.
