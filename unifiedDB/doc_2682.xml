   A tanker carrying 13.2 million pounds of
hazardous chemicals ran aground Friday in Lake Erie, but there was
no leakage and the ship was freed a few hours later by Coast Guard
tugboats.
   The 428-foot tanker Kiisla, built and registered in Finland, was
towed by two tugs to the Buffalo Port Authority for inspection.
   The accident tore a hole in the outer hull of the tanker, but
the inner hull was not damaged, Petty Officer Ray Cramer said. The
ship took on some water but did not leak any cargo, Cramer said.
   The Kiisla has an icebreaking hull and is a ``sturdy vessel,''
said Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Vern Williams in Buffalo.
   Petty Officer Ray Cramer said the tanker draws 21 feet of water,
but neither he nor Williams knew how deep the bottom was where it
went aground in the mostly ice-covered lake outside Buffalo harbor.
   The tanker was carrying 3,141 metric tons of xylene and 2,876
metric tons of toluene, or about 13.2 million pounds of the two
industrial solvents, to Buffalo, Williams said. Authorities did not
know where the cargo originated.
