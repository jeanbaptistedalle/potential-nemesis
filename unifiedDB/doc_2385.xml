   Love's labor has not been lost for Jabra
Ibrahim Jabra, one of the giants of contemporary Arab letters who
has translated Shakespeare's plays and sonnets into Arabic. Critics
say they are the best translations of The Bard yet in Arabic.
   It took him 24 years, from 1959 to 1983, to translate
``Hamlet,'' ``Coriolanus,'' ``King Lear,'' ``Macbeth,''
``Othello,'' ``The Tempest'' and 40 of the sonnets.
   Now he says that's it.
   ``I wanted to translate all his plays,'' Jabra said in an
interview at his home in a fashionable Baghdad suburb. ``But after
finishing `The Tempest' I realized it was virtually impossible. I'd
never have the time to do anything else.''
   He said ``The Tempest,'' which he completed in 1979, was the
toughest to translate because ``it was deceptively lyrical, which
makes it very difficult to render in another language.''
   ``His translations of Shakespeare and other Western works are
very, very beautiful,'' said Professor Abbas al-Tonsi of the
American University in Cairo.
   Eisa Abu-Shamsieh, an Arab academic, noted in a literary thesis
on Jabra that his Shakespeare translations ``as well as scholarly
studies on Shakespeare's works stand as a remarkable contribution
to the modern Arabic drama in particular, and literature in
general. His accuracy in translation is a characteristic upon which
his critics agree.''
   Jabra, 69, is one of the most prolific and versatile Arab
writers; he is a novelist, poet, essayist, critic and translator as
well as artist.
   He has translated Oscar Wilde, Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant,
Chekov, Andre Maurois, Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Ezra Pound,
Edith Sitwell and William Faulkner along with many English poets
such as Shelley, Keats, Dryden and Byron.
   ``It took me a year to do `Hamlet,' the first Shakespeare play I
translated,'' Jabra said.
   ``It was an agony and a pleasure,'' he added, sitting in his
study lined with books in Arabic, English and French as well as
paintings and sculptures by himself and other Iraqi artists.
   ``It was something I'd always wanted to do. I'd had this
ambition since I was a young man,'' he explained.
   ``Ever since I first read `Julius Ceasar' in Jerusalem when I
was a boy I'd always wondered if it was possible to make
Shakespeare's characters talk in Arabic without losing the force of
his words in English.''
   When he studied at Cambridge University in England, he found
that Arabic translations of Shakespeare were ``verbally awkward,
strangely static.''
   So he decided to do his own and found himself immersed in ``the
almost impossible task'' of sustaining the ``same verbal charge,
the evocative imagery, sustained metaphors, diversity of rhythm and
tone, the eloquence and the word play'' into another language.
   Apart from such works as his novel ``Hunters in a Narrow
Street,'' which was originally written in English and published in
1960, and several collections of poetry, he has written seven major
novels in Arabic, among them ``The Ship,'' ``The Search For Walid
Masoud'' and ``The Other Rooms.''
   Professor Tonsi noted: ``Jabra and another novelist,
Abdel-Rahman Munir, are considered the only two Arab novelists
whose influence could go beyond that of Naguib Mahfouz,'' who won
the 1988 Nobel Prize for Literature.
   Jabra was born in Bethlehem in pre-1948 Palestine, the son of a
Christian farmer who fell on hard times, forcing the family to move
to Jerusalem.
   There, Jabra quit school to work as a carpenter and plumber. But
he continued studying at the Arab College and later went to
Cambridge. In 1952-54, he studied at Harvard.
   He returned to Palestine in 1943 and worked as a teacher in
Jerusalem before being driven into exile, at the age of 29, when
the state of Israel was declared.
   Exile has been one of the central creative forces of his life,
engendering a passion for his Arab heritage and Arab nationalism.
He converted to Islam in Baghdad, where he wound up in 1948.
   He taught English literature at Baghdad's College of Arts and,
he said, ``preached change unashamedly.''
   He said he told his students: ``We lost Palestine because we had
confronted a ruthless force with an outmoded tradition.
   ``We had been cheated and betrayed by thousands of years of
decay. We've been victims of our insane rhetoric.''
   Jabra noted as he puffed on his ever-present pipe: ``Change has
to begin with a change of vision, with a new way of looking at
things.''
   Jabra's understanding of the West and European literature has
combined with a burning belief, shared by many Arab intellectuals,
that the Arab world has to change in all facets of life to survive
and preserve its rich heritage.
   The heroes of his novels are generally Arab intellectuals
standing alone, facing up to the unknown and dreaming of change.
   Like other Arab writers who have long fought decline and
darkness, Jabra believes he has a special obligation to the young
Arab generation, and that as a writer he can do that only through
vision and awareness.
   To that end, he now writes exclusively in Arabic.
   ``I write not only to renew my own energy, but above all to
renew the energy within the new Arab generation,'' he said.
