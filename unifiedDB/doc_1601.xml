   The U.S. armed forces offered rewards
Saturday of up to $5,000 in ``cash, not checks'' to Panamanians who
turn in bullets, grenades, pistols and automatic weapons.
   In a radio broadcast, the U.S. military said the weapons had to
be ``personally'' turned in.
   But it warned: ``It is important the weapon be wrapped in a
white sheet and be held high so we know you don't present a
threat.''
   In addition to $1 million being offered for information leading
to the arrest of ousted strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the
rewards listed were: $25 for ammunition or hand grenades, $50 for
rocket grenades, $100 for pistols, $150 for automatic weapons, and
$5,000 for a weapons cache.
   ``You will be paid in cash, not checks or money orders,'' the
broadcast said. ``Let us eliminate arms from the streets so there
can be peace and democracy in Panama.''
