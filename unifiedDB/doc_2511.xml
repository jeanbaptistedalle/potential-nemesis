<HEAD>Five Stabbed To Death, Seven Injured In Black Faction Fight</HEAD>

   Street fighting between rival
groups near the southern town of Uitenhage left at least five black
men dead and seven seriously injured, police reported today.
   Police said the battle Thursday was part of an ongoing feud
between supporters of the United Democratic Front, a nationwide
anti-apartheid coalition, and a group of ``Africanists.''
   Most Africanists are aligned with the outlawed Pan Africanist
Congress, which favors black self-reliance in the quest of
political rights as opposed to the Front's multiracial approach.
   Those killed and injured ranged in age from 16 to 43 and were
stabbed or suffered blows to the head during two hours of fighting
in Kwanobuhle, a township outside Uitenhage, police said.
   The two groups have fought sporadically for political control of
the area since 1987, according to the independent South Africa
Press Association.
   The Front also is involved in a power struggle in Natal
Province, where fighting with Inkatha, a relatively conservative
Zulu organization, has left about 2,500 people dead over the past
three years.
