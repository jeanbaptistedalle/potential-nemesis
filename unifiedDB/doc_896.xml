<HEAD>Southeastern Asset Increases Saatchi Stake to 11.2 Percent</HEAD>

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's largest
advertising holding company, said Wednesday that the investment
company Southeastern Asset Management has increased its stake in
the troubled company to 11.2 percent.
   Southeastern, based in Memphis, Tenn., had previously declared
on Sept. 18 that it owned a 10.2 percent stake in Saatchi.
   Its president O. Mason Hawkins was quoted Wednesday in the
Saatchi news release as saying the stake-building indicated his
company's support for Saatchi's management.
   ``We are long-term investors who seek to find undervalued
companies, which have management determined to achieve substantial
profit improvement and to enhance shareholder value,'' Hawkins said.
   Southeastern has increased its shareholding to 17.788 million
ordinary shares, Saatchi said.
   A Saatchi official, who didn't want to be identified, said
company officials ``welcome long-term holders in the company and
Hawkins is obviously in that category.''
   Some analysts have speculated that Southeastern is taking its
stake in the hope that Saatchi eventually will become the subject
of a bid.
   Earlier this month, Saatchi reported a net loss of 58.5 million
pounds, or $94 million, for the year ended Sept. 30, reflecting
troubles in its consulting business which the company has placed up
for sale.
   It recently appointed a new chief executive, French businessman
Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
