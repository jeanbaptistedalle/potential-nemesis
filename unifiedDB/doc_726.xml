   AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories says it has
developed an integrated circuit that can turn a computer chip's
single-lane processing of information into a busy freeway.
   The photonic integrated circuit opens the way to vastly more
powerful computers, the company said Tuesday.
   It will enable scientists to build optical computer systems,
which would use light pulses as well as electricity to transmit
information, AT&amp;T said from its Solid State Technology Center near
Allentown.
   ``The results may be very important to everyone, once they start
happening'' within a few year to a decade, said Leo Chirovsky, a
research scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J. He cited
weather forecasting as a possible application.
   The device has 2,048 elements, each of which can switch on or
off in less than one-billionth of a second when illuminated by a
low-power light beam.
   If one thinks of a computer chip as a city, computers until now
have been designed on the premise that information comes in and
goes out on narrow roads, Chirovsky said.
   ``This is the equivalent of providing a huge, multi-lane highway
on a chip that will promote a whole new way of looking at
computing,'' he said.
