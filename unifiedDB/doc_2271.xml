   A Canada goose caught off-guard by a fast
freeze was trapped by its feet in ice on a pond, and it looks as if
there's little hope of a quick rescue.
   The goose, attended by its mournfully honking mate, caught the
eye of Wayne Wilson as he walked around a pond at Crowders Mountain
State Park. The goose's webbed feet were stuck in about four inches
of ice.
   But his report brought little action Wednesday from wildlife
officials, who preferred to let nature take its course as
temperatures rise at the pond 30 miles west of Charlotte.
   Wayne Smith, head of the Gaston County Animal Control
Department, said goose rescue is out of his jurisdiction.
   ``They're used to this kind of weather,'' he said of the birds.
``They can take care of themselves. Just throw some bread out to
them.''
