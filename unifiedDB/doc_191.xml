   President Bush today wished the nation a
joyous Hanukkah and a Merry Christmas.
   To Jews, who begin celebrating the eight days of Hanukkah at
sundown Friday, Bush recalled that the holiday commemorates a great
victory won by the Jewish Maccabees in their struggle to worship
freely in their own way.
   ``This year, as Jews around the world pause to observe this
festival, all of us can share in the joy of those people who are
just beginning to enjoy success in their own struggle for freedom
and self-determination,'' Bush said.
   He told Christians that the promise of the first Christmas
continues to give a sense of peace and purpose.
   ``It is daily acts of goodness and generosity, performed time
and time again throughout the year, that hold the true meaning of
this holy season.
   ``Every kind and selfless deed we perform for others can
rekindle in our hearts and in our communities the light of that
first Christmas,'' Bush said.
