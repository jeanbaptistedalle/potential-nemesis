   One of several sky divers who leaped from a
high-rise was killed early Sunday when his parachute either became
tangled or snagged on the building, authorities said.
   The 57-year-old man, whose name was not immediately released,
jumped from the Century City building more than 40 stories high
about 1:30 a.m. with four or five other people, said police Sgt.
Curt Hussey. He plunged into a construction site.
   The victim was flown to UCLA Medical Center, where he died later
in the morning, Hussey said.
   Another parachutist, whose name was not released, was cited for
trespassing. The other sky divers fled before police arrived,
Hussey said.
