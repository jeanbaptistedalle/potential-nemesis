   A Catholic priest who died after

Party newspaper Rude Pravo said Saturday.
   The priest, who was not identified in the report, was found
unconscious Dec. 20 in the rectory of Naceradec, about 45 miles
southeast of Prague, the newspaper Rude Pravo said.
   Shortly after being taken to hospital, he died of brain swelling
and pneumonia, the daily said. It said the priest also had bruises
on his face and neck.
