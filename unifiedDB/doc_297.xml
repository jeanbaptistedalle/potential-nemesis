   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 has not
reduced the popularity of Syracuse University's overseas study
program, its director says.
   No one backed out of the International Studies Abroad program
last spring, just after 35 returning students were killed in the
bombing, Nirelle Galson said. A handful of students did switch
flights from an American airline to a foreign one, she said.
   In the just ended semester, about 820 students went abroad to
study, about a 10 percent increase, she said.
   ``We had a number of parents and students call asking about
safety prior to departure, but it seemed they were simply seeking
reassuarances,'' said Galson.
   ``I thought we'd have some downturn in the spring, but it hasn't
happened. But I can't say we wouldn't have had a 20 percent
increase (in participation) if it didn't happen.''
