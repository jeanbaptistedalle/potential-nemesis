   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _President Bush ordered American troops into action in Panama to
``protect American lives, restore the democratic process, preserve
the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties and apprehend Manuel
Noriega.''
   _Almost 9,500 additional soldiers, including paratroopers, were
flown in from the United States to supplement the 12,000 troops
based in Panama.
   _U.S. troops backed by warplanes and armored personnel carriers
attacked Panamanian military headquarters in Panama City and other
military bases.
   _Noriega was not captured and was said to be in hiding,
directing his forces.
   _At least nine Americans were killed in battle with hostilities
still under way. Preliminary reports said more than 40 other people
were killed, but the toll was expected to rise.
   _Opposition leader Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president
and the United States recognized his government.
