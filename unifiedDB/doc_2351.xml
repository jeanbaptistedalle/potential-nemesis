   The Justice Department says it obtained guilty
pleas or convictions in 107 environmental criminal cases in the
last fiscal year, a record.
   Richard Stewart, assistant attorney general for the land and
natural resources division, said the numbers reflected a 70 percent
increase over the previous year and demonstrate the Bush
administration's commitment to environmental protection.
   But department officials acknowledged Thursday that many of the
107 cases concluded during the fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30
and cited in Wednesday's announcement may have been initiated
before President Bush took office last January.
   The number of indictments alleging environmental crimes actually
declined in fiscal 1989 by about 20 percent to 101, the lowest
number in three years, compared with 124 in 1988 and 127 in 1987.
   Spokeswoman Amy Casner acknowledged that the sharp increase in
the number of cases won in fiscal 1989 in part reflected the high
number of indictments filed in previous years.
   She said she did not know how many of the 107 convictions
reflected cases initiated in earlier years.
   The 107 cases resulted in the collection of $12.7 million in
fines, including a $2.25 million penalty paid by Ashland Oil Co.
for the discharge of 500,000 gallons of diesel fuel into the Ohio
River.
   Justice had sought $7.5 million from Protex Industries for
endangering workers at a hazardous waste site, but a judge later
suspended all but about $400,000 of that fine. Ms. Casner said the
suspended portion of the fine was not included in the $12.7 million.
