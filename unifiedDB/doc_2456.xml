   A New York investment firm said
Thursday it had agreed to pay $450 million to purchase Color Tile
Inc., a Fort Worth-based national floor covering retailer.
   Investcorp, which has purchased such firms as Tiffany &amp; Co.,
Gucci and the Carvel Ice Cream company in recent years, said it
would buy Color Tile from Knoll International Holdings Inc.
   Investcorp said current Color Tile management participated in
the deal.
   Color Tile operates 700 U.S. stores and said it expects 1989
revenues of more than $460 million.
   Knoll International is a private, New York-based company whose
holdings include the office-furniture maker Knoll and New York's
``21'' Club. It put Color Tile up for sale in June. It had acquired
the chain in 1986 for an undisclosed price.
