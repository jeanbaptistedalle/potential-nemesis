   Two weeks of pounding rains in
northern Brazil have killed 32 people and left thousands homeless,
civil defense officials said Thursday.
   Worst hit was the state of Bahia, where 24 people died and
25,000 were left homeless, according to the Rio daily newspaper
Jornal do Brasil.
   Gloria Pires da Silva, a civil defense official in the city of
Santa Barbara, said 18 people died after six cars fell into a
30-foot hole that opened up after a road crumbled.
   Five others drowned when rivers flooded, and a man in the town
of Feira de Santana died of a heart attack when he woke up and
discovered several feet of water in his home, Jornal do Brasil
reported.
   In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, eight people died and
15,000 people were homeless, said state official Capt. Geraldo
Teixeira. Seven of the eight drowned in the colonial city of Ouro
Preto when waters swept a shantytown.
   Heavy rains fell throughout northern Brazil and hundreds have
been left homeless in the rural states of Piaui, Maranhao, Goias
and Tocantins.
