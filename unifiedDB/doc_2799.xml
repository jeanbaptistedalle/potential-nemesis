   The mayor of this northern town said
Saturday that Roman Catholic Church authorities sent him a bill for
over $20,000 for a series of special Masses celebrated since 1630.
   The church said the town requested the special Masses in the
17th century when it was troubled by the plague.
   Mayor Giuliano Gaigher said church authorities were insisting on
payment of 10,000 lire (about $9) for each of seven votive Masses
celebrated each year since 1630. That would bring the total bill to
about $22,000.
   ``We are doing historical research. We haven't found any
commitment by the town'' to pay for the Masses, Gaigher said in a
telephone interview.
   Votive Masses are celebrated for a special reason or a
particular function, such as a wedding.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted local church officials as
saying they were willing to work out a solution but still believed
it should be paid.
