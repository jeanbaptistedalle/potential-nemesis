<HEAD>Report: Subway Gunman Has Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz has cancer,
according to a televised report.
   Goetz, 41, said in papers filed in State Supreme Court in the
Bronx that he has been unable to appear in court because he had
major surgery last month and is undergoing radiation treatments,
WNBC-TV reported Monday.
   The report did not say what type of cancer Goetz has or how
serious it is.
   Goetz, who is white, became a symbol of New York City's racial
tensions after he shot four black youths in a subway on Dec. 22,
1984.
   Goetz claimed the four were trying to rob him; the youths said
they were panhandling for change to play videogames.
   Darrell Cabey, one of the teen-agers shot by Goetz, has filed a
$50 million lawsuit against the gunman. Cabey is paralyzed from the
waist down from the shooting.
   Goetz was convicted of illegal gun possession and acquitted of
attempted murder and assault in 1987.
