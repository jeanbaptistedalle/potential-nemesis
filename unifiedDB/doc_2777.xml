   At least 75 people, many of them
homeless, have died of exposure to cold overnight temperatures in
northern India and Bangladesh during the last three days, news
reports said Saturday.
   Temperatures plummeted to near freezing, chilling people who
have little in the way of clothing or shelter to cope with the
brief winter in this normally hot, sunny region.
   At least nine more deaths were reported Friday in Bangladesh,
bringing the toll to 44 since Wednesday, newspapers in Dhaka said.
   In India, 20 people have died of the cold in northern Bihar
state since Wednesday night, United News of India reported from
Patna, the state capital.
   Seven people, including four homeless people, died of cold in
the same period in neighboring Uttar Pradesh state, Press Trust of
India said. It added that many birds were found dead of cold in the
fields.
   Gujarat state reported four deaths, Press Trust said.
   The mercury dipped to 38 degrees, the lowest temperature of the
season, in New Delhi on Friday night and to 41 in Bihar and
northern Bangladesh.
   Midday highs this week have reached the low 60s, but many
people, even those with shelter, are ill-equipped to cope with the
overnight temperatures.
   Most of Bangladesh's 110 million people live in houses with mud
floors and walls made of thin straw mats.
   In both countries, the homeless sleep on the ground, with the
luckier ones wrapped in blankets. Some kindle small fires with
scavenged scraps of paper.
