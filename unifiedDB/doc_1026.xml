   A Nicaraguan diplomat was intercepted by
gunmen on a street and shot to death Thursday, authorities said.
   The victim was identified as Jorge Adolfo Vargas, a second
secretary at the Nicaraguan Embassy, said a fire department officer
who insisted on anonymity.
   Vargas, 38, was intercepted by the gunmen as he was walking to
the embassy in the southeastern part of the capital, shot him and
fled, the officer said.
   The fire department was told of the shooting by an anonymous
telephone caller. No one claimed responsibility for the killing.
   By the time a fire brigade arrived on the scene, Vargas was
already dead, the officer said. The body was taken to the city
morgue, where he was identified.
   An employee at the Nicaraguan Embassy, who answered the
telephone but refused to give his name, confirmed that Vargas had
been assassinated. He said he had no further information.
   Leftist guerrillas have been active in Guatemala for more than
four decades, as have secret rightist death squads who have been
hunting down suspected rebels.
