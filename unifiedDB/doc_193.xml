   Gov. Rose Mofford awaited surgery today to remove
her gallbladder.
   The 67-year-old Democrat had been admitted to the cardiac unit
at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center with chest pain Sunday,
but tests found no heart trouble, doctors said. Instead, she was
found to be suffering from a gallbladder attack and gallstones.
   The operation, which could last up to three hours, was to begin
around noon, said Dr. Victor Zannis, her surgeon. He said there is
``over a 90 percent chance that she's going to be just fine'' and
that the average hospital stay after the operation is seven to 10
days.
   The hospital said the governor was in stable condition and had
slept well. Dr. Michael Altman, a gastroenterologist, said she was
in some pain.
   Mrs. Mofford's doctors said they didn't know what caused the
attack but that her family had a history of gallbladder and heart
problems.
   Arizona's first woman governor had been secretary of state for
31 years when she succeeded Republican Evan Mecham in 1988 upon his
impeachment and removal by the Legislature.
