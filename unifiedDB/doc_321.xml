   Rien Poortvliet lives in a rustic house in the
tiny Dutch village of Soestduinen. On a recent walk, the author
found a chestnut on the ground and began kicking it ahead of him.
After losing the first chestnut, he quickly found another and
continued.
   He's no better when it comes to sleep. Anything less than seven
hours and he's miserable the next day. Away from home, he dreams of
lying on his new, firm mattress, with his four dogs snoring by the
bed and the window open so he can hear the owls over a cool, night
breeze.
   Some might consider this behavior immature or childish.
   Childish? Poortvliet happily agrees.
   ``My friend, Wil (author Huygen), has said, `When you have the
child in your heart, be careful to keep it there, not to lose it,''
said Poortvliet, who collaborated with Huygen on the best-selling
children's book ``Gnomes'' and the new ``The Book of the Sandman''
($17.95, Abrams).
   ``When making books or drawings, I do have the child in my
heart,'' he said. ``I don't want to let that part of myself get
away.''
   American author Delia Ephron lives in a house in Los Angeles.
She was once childish, she admits. As a kid, she hated coming
downstairs when her parents invited friends over; Ephron was 25
years old before she actually threw a party of her own.
   But she's changed now. She would certainly never kick a chestnut
_ that, she says, would be impolite. Ephron has a more
sophisticated way of relaxing: She makes up tests for her nieces
and nephews, impromptu multiple choice exams on etiquette for all
occasions.
   For instance, you're at a restaurant and the waiter brings you
soup. You're about to eat when you notice there's a fly in it. Do
you: A. Swat it. B. Eat it. C. Say to the waiter, ``Excuse me, but
a fly is swimming in my soup.''
   The kids always laugh, Ephron says, and her nieces proudly
provide the right answer (the nephews proudly give the wrong one).
``Aunt Delia,'' as she calls herself in her work, believes a comedy
of manners works better than drama.
   ``It's such a great way to teach manners without ever really
teaching manners,'' said Ephron, whose newest book, ``Do I Have to
Say Hello?'' ($14.95, Viking), includes pages of offbeat quizzes.
   ``I think of children as uncivilized and that's what I love the
most about them,'' she said. ``I wrote this as much to write about
what they really do than to teach them the right thing to do.''
   Ephron seemed born to write, although not necessarily for
children. One sister, Nora, is the author of ``Heartburn'' and
wrote the screenplay for ``When Harry Met Sally ...''; another
sister, Hallie, is a novelist.
   Delia Ephron had been at work for about a year when she dashed
off ``How to Eat Like a Child,'' a short piece that was published
in 1979. ``Aunt Delia'' had arrived.
   ``I was very nervous about being a writer because everyone in my
family was a writer,'' said Ephron, now collaborating with Nora on
the screenplay for the Meg Wolitzer novel, ``This Is Your Life.''
   ``One day I wrote this piece and very quickly wrote it. I didn't
think I was writing a book for children. I was writing an adult
book; the original piece was written in the New York Times. I was
absolutely shocked when kids thought it was funny. I suddenly knew
that this was what I knew how to do,'' she said.
   Poortvliet, on the other hand, had been an artist for years in
an advertising agency, but happily gave up his comfortable salary
in the early 1970s for the chance to illustrate children's books.
   He speaks not only of the gift for writing, but the gift of
writing. Sharing with a child ``The Book of the Sandman,'' and
earlier works such as ``Gnomes'' and ``Noah's Ark,'' is like
pulling up a chair and carefully explaining a remarkable adventure.
   ``Making children's books does not mean making childish
drawings,'' he said. ``For all my books, `Dogs' or `Noah's Ark,' I
use my drawings to tell and to show, `Come here and look how
elegant a doe can jump over a fence.'''
   Ephron also insists that writing, especially for children,
requires a special generosity of spirit.
   ``I wasn't someone who wanted to be around children, but I do
think there's an emotional connection that you make,'' she said.
``It's more than thinking like a child, it's some sort of emotional
understanding of childhood.
   ``I think what you're going to write as a creative person is
pretty well set by the time you're 14. It's about who you are and
your take on life, something that sets in when you're very young.''
   While ``Do I Have to Say Hello?'' can be read anywhere _ the
dinner table (with the parents' permission, of course), the
playground, the car _ ``The Book of the Sandman'' is very much a
bedtime book, to be cuddled like a favorite stuffed animal.
   ``It starts with the teddy bear in bed and the feeling of that
cozy, warm teddy bear,'' Poortvliet said. ``And I believe that's
the work of those books, they do the same like the teddy bear
does.''
