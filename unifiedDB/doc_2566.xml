<HEAD>Cold Remedy Ad Gives White House Headache</HEAD>

   The White House on Friday turned up its
nose at advertisements for a decongestant featuring President Bush
and Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ``Heads of state don't
endorse cold medicine,'' said Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater registered objections to ads for Drixoral, an
across-the-counter head cold remedy manufactured by Schering Corp.
   The ads, in both newspaper and television versions, show
Gorbachev and Bush shaking hands at the superpower summit in Malta
earlier this month.
   ``In the New Year, may the only cold war in the world be the one
we're fighting,'' asserts the advertisements.
   But the ads clearly are giving the White House a headache.
   ``We do not approve or sanction or acknowledge any of these
commercial endorsements and we appreciate the two television
networks that declined to run them,'' said Fitzwater.
   ABC and CBS have refused to carry the spot.
   ``Heads of state don't endorse cold medicine. Period,'' said
Fitzwater.
   ``Some ad man gets high marks for imagination and ingenuity, but
he may have to pay for this one himself,'' Fitzwater said. He did
not elaborate.
