<HEAD>Stepped-Up Anti-Drug Program Allots Four-Fold Increase to California</HEAD>

   The Justice Department announced Friday a
nearly four-fold increase in federal money for anti-drug abuse
programs in California in its first allocation of state aid under a
stepped-up program approved by Congress.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the money is part of the
Bush administration's efforts to help communities ``attack the
problem at the point of consumption.''
   He said the department is urging states to incorporate
recommendations of President Bush's national drug control strategy
into their programs.
   California, the first state to receive funds for fiscal year
1990, will get $39.7 million, almost $30 million more than its 1989
grant of $10.8 million. Under a plan adopted by California, nearly
65 percent of the money will be distributed to local communities.
   ``The California plan was approved within two weeks of being
received, and the money is being distributed in less than six weeks
after the president signed the appropriations legislation,''
Thornburgh said in a statement.
   The department said its Bureau of Justice Assistance is
receiving and reviewing grant applications from other states.
Congress appropriated $395 million for the grants.
   The funds will enable California to continue supporting 36
projects including investigative task forces and specialized
prosecution initiatives, the department said. It said part of the
grant would be distributed to counties on the basis of population
and severity of crime.
