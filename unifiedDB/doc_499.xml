<HEAD>Pettersson Demands $320,000 after Acquittal in Palme Murder</HEAD>

   Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old
drifter acquitted of the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme,
wants $320,000 in compensation for the 10 months he was jailed for
questioning and trial, news reports said Tuesday.
   Pettersson, who has a long history of drug abuse and crime, was
convicted in July but won an appeal on the grounds of insufficient
evidence.
   He previously said he was not interested in the money.
   ``This is a lot of money, but it is also a very unusual case,''
the national TT news agency quoted Pettersson's lawyer, Arne
Liljeros, as saying. ``Christer Pettersson was detained for a long
period, and he has had to suffer much publicity. He is marked for
the rest of his life.''
   After his release, Pettersson rejected a police offer to
relocate him and give him a new identity.
   Palme, prime minister for 11 years, was shot on a Stockholm
street while walking home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Authorities have said Pettersson remains a suspect. He could be
tried again under Swedish law, but only on the basis of compelling
new evidence.
