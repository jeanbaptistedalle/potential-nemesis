<HEAD>Spill From Iranian Tanker Threatens Moroccan Coastline</HEAD>

   Morocco appealed for help Sunday in its
battle to keep a 230-square-mile oil slick off its coastline and to
stop more oil from spilling from an Iranian tanker damaged in an
explosion two weeks ago.
   The spill was just 17 miles from shore when the government
issued the appeal on the official Moroccan Press Agency.
   An explosion aboard the Iranian tanker Khark on Dec. 19 tore
through the ship's hull as it sailed 400 miles north of Las Palmas
in the Canary Islands. The cause of the explosion was not known.
   A subsequent fire forced the 35 crew members to abandon ship,
and the vessel and her leaking cargo began drifting toward
northwest Africa.
   Morocco appealed to Britain, France, Spain and Portugal for help
in cleaning up the 37 million gallons of petroleum that spilled
from the tanker and formed the huge slick, the news agency said.
   Even French marine scientist Jacques-Yves Cousteau was asked to
help.
   The ship, which was loaded with 142 million gallons of oil, was
floating Sunday about 45 miles off the city of Safi, south of
Rabat. Specialists were trying to plug the gash in the hull.
   Potential damage to fishing stocks, tourism and other coastal
industries could cost 100,000 people their jobs, the news agency
said. An ``ecological catastrophe'' will result if the slick
reaches land, it added.
   King Hassan II's government formed a council to deal with the
crisis, but experts have had little luck dispersing the slick, the
news agency said.
