<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Driver in Billy Martin Death Was Intoxicated</HEAD>

   The man who was driving the pickup truck
in which former New York Yankee manager Billy Martin was killed was
legally intoxicated at the time of the accident, a prosecutor said
today.
   Results of the blood-alcohol test support the charge that
William Reedy was drunk when he drove Martin's truck off the road
outside Martin's 148-acre farm near Binghamton, Kevin Guyette of
the Broome County district attorney's office said.
   Guyette refused to say what Reedy's blood alcohol level was, but
he said Reedy was charged under the New York state law that says a
person is intoxicated when his blood-alcohol level is at least 0.10
percent.
   Martin, 61, died Christmas night when the truck in which he was
a passenger skidded off an icy rural road and into a ditch outside
his farm.
   Reedy, owner of Reedy's Bar near Detroit's Tiger Stadium,
remained in a hospital with a broken hip and possible broken ribs.
   Martin's funeral is scheduled for Friday morning at St.
Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan. Burial plans are pending.
   Investigators said it wasn't relevant whether Martin, as well
known for his barroom brawls as for his managerial prowess, had
been drinking before the accident because he was a passenger in his
own truck when it crashed.
   Reedy, a long-time Martin friend, was charged with driving while
intoxicated, a misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in jail and a
$1,000 fine.
