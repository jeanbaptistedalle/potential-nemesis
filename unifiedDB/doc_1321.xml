   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet
legislators today voiced support for the popular uprising in
Romania.
   During today's session of the Soviet Congress, Gorbachev, who
chaired the proceedings, periodically doubled as news announcer and
read aloud the latest reports from Romania as the regime of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu toppled.
   When he announced that Romanian Radio was reporting Ceausescu
had been arrested, the Congress broke into applause.
   He then proposed a resolution to send Romanians a vote of
support for the changes there, and the motion passed overwhelmingly.
   ``At this crucial period for the fate of Romania,'' the
resolution said, ``the Second Congress of People's Deputies offers
its decisive support for the just cause of the people of Romania.''
   ``We declare to the citizens of Romania our traditional feeling
of friendship and good-neighborliness and stress our sincere
striving for close cooperation in the interest of socialism and
peace,'' it concluded.
   Earlier in the day, the Congress passed a resolution expressing
serious concern over the dramatic events in Romania and called for
a peaceful end to the unrest.
   The first resolution was adopted after Gorbachev announced that
information received from Soviet diplomats in Romania indicated
that the situation had seriously worsened overnight. He did not
elaborate.
   That resolution expressed hopes for a peaceful settlement of
Romania's problems ``in the spirit of tolerance, humaneness and
respect for human rights.''
