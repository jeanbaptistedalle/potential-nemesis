   Specialists refloated a grounded oil tanker
on Wednesday and traffic resumed in the Suez Canal, canal officials
said.
   The 138,536-ton Liberian-registered Lauberhorn had just begun
its northward passage from Suez when it ran aground in heavy fog
just north of the city Tuesday morning.
   At least 109 ships had to wait for the east-west passage to be
cleared.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
after about 10,000 tons of crude oil were taken off the Lauberhorn,
the tanker was refloated at high tide at 2:50 p.m. Canal traffic
was resumed at 11 p.m.
   They said the tanker was towed to Zenobia area, near Suez, which
is at the canal's southern tip.
   The grounding caused a crack in the bow up to nine feet long,
leading to a minor spill from the 73,000 tons of crude the ship had
taken on at an Iranian terminal in the Persian Gulf.
   Ezzat Adel, the Suez Canal Authority's director, said the spill
had been cleaned up and the crack sealed.
   The Lauberhorn is managed by Brokerage and Management Co. of New
York City, according to Lloyd's Registry.
