   A 5-year-old Texas boy was accidentally
left at a service station when his family got back on the highway
and didn't noticed his absence until stopping for dinner two hours
later.
   ``This is embarrassing, but I'm glad he's safe,'' said his
father, Glenn Payne. ``We've all had a scare this evening.''
   Tyler Payne got out of the family's station wagon to use the
restroom Friday afternoon, then couldn't get out of the building
because the door had become stuck.
   Meanwhile, his family headed for Texas.
   Two hours and over 100 miles later, his parents, five brothers
and a sister stopped at a restaurant in Jackson, Tenn., and noticed
Tyler was missing.
   Back in Nashville, Tyler had been freed by a woman who heard him
shouting.
   The boy spent the next few hours with detectives, who amused him
with teddy bears, coloring books and candy.
   The Paynes had spent Christmas with Kris Payne's parents in
Knoxville and were on their way home to Weatherford, Texas, when
they stopped at the service station.
   ``We normally have a head count, but this time we didn't,''
Payne said. ``We were tired.''
