   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
Thursday he will travel to the Soviet Union in February and March,
and expected to meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I have been prepared for this visit for a long time. I want to
talk about political subjects, also social subjects, but above all
I want to talk about trade unions,'' Walesa said at a news
conference in the port of Gdansk.
   Walesa said his advisers are preparing the visit, but there was
no need to rush the trip.
   The Solidarity leader traveled to Moscow for the first time Dec.
18 to attend the funeral of fellow human rights activist and Nobel
Peace Prize winner Andrei D. Sakharov.
   Solidarity activists have been developing contacts in recent
months with opposition activists both in Moscow and other major
cities in the Soviet Union.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, an adviser to Walesa when the
union was born in 1980 and during the years it was banned, met with
Sakharov and other members of the pro-democratic opposition during
his first visit to Moscow in November.
