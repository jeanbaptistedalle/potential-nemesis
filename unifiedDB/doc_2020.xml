   Prices closed narrowly mixed on Wall Street
today after concerns about inflation and higher interest rates
eroded the stock market's earlier moderate gains.
   Stocks tracked the bond market for much of the session,
declining in early trading as Treasury prices slumped. Wall Street
later shook off the drop in bonds, but in late afternoon, when bond
prices continued to drop, stocks gave up their gains.
   Treasury prices skidded first because of an increase in a key
Japanese interest rate and in later trading because of a surge in
oil prices after several oil companies reported refinery shutdowns.
   The January price for a gallon of home heating oil jumped nearly
10.74 cents to 92.48 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
while the Treasury's 30-year bond was down about 1\ point, or
$12.50 per $1,000 in face amount. The bond's yield soared to 7.98
percent from 7.88 late Friday.
   Rising energy prices are considered a harbinger of higher
inflation and, in turn, higher interest rates.
