   When Rocky Peterson set up an elaborate
lighting display this Christmas season, his girlfriend was left
glowing.
   Peterson proposed to DeDe High by stringing 150 feet of
Christmas lights with the message ``MARRY ME'' across the roof of
his barn in south-central Nebraska.
   It got her attention, and the quick reply of ``yes.''
   ``I wanted to do something special,'' Peterson said recently.
   On the day in late November Peterson hung the lights, he called
Miss High and asked her to meet him out at his place.
   ``As I drove into the driveway he plugged in the lights. I was
caught completely off guard,'' she said.
   ``I was so surprised when I saw the lights that I was
speechless,'' Miss High said. ``In fact it took me a while to
answer. But when I could talk again, I said `Yes.'''
   Peterson said he plans to leave the light display on the barn
until New Year's.
   The couple, both 27, have dated for about a year. Their wedding
date is March 24.

   PINETOP-LAKESIDE, Ariz. (AP) _ There's no business like snow
business in the White Mountains of Arizona. And without snow, the
Pinetop-Lakeside Town Council fears there'll be no business at all
this year.
   The council, noting that Thursday was the first day of winter
and not a flake had fallen, adopted a resolution that day mandating
a white Christmas for the not-so-White Mountains.
   The resolution calls for at least a 6-inch accumulation of snow
on Christmas Day, followed by a regular snowfall each day
thereafter, with a total of 60 inches or more by the end of the
winter.
   The resolution doesn't set a penalty for failure to comply.
