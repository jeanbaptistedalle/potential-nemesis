   The resting place of Nobel Peace Prize winner and
human rights champion Andrei D. Sakharov is Vostryakovskoye
Cemetery, Moscow's largest.
   It is a sprawling 19th century cemetery set amid pine trees in
southwestern Moscow.
   Sakharov's coffin was lowered into a grave Monday in a plot
beside that of his mother-in-law, Ruth Bonner.
   The cemetery is at the crossroads of the Borovskoye Highway and
Moscow Ring Road at the city limit. Historically, it was the
graveyard of the Vostryakovo village and became a Moscow city
cemetery in 1932. It was expanded in 1963 to its current size of
370 acres.
   Among those buried in the cemetery are marshals, generals,
academicians and honored Soviet citizens. It is divided into
Russian and Jewish sections, and also contains graves of people of
mixed nationalities.
   Mrs. Bonner was a Stalin-era political prisoner who died in
Moscow at age 87 in 1987. Also nearby is the grave of Mrs. Bonner's
son, Igor Alikhanov, an officer in the Soviet merchant marine who
died in 1976 at the age of 49.
