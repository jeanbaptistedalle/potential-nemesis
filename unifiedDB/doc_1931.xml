   _Romanian television shows tape of deposed leader Nicolae
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, after they were executed by firing
squad for crimes against Romania. They lay crumpled on the ground
in front of a bullet-riddled wall. Earlier, television showed
footage of the couple at what is believed to have been their secret
trial.
   _ Romanians cheer the executions and Romanian sources say the
security forces loyal to Ceausescu are beginning to surrender en
masse.
   _ The new revolutionary government says Ceausescu and his
security forces killed 60,000 people during his 24-year rule.
Television shows what is described as a torture chamber in
Timisoara.
   _The revolutionary council names its informal leader, Ion
Iliescu, a former official ousted by Ceausescu, as chairman of the
governing council. It also names Petre Roman, a 43-year-old
professor of hydraulic engineeering with no political background,
as prime minister.
   _ The provisional leadership repeals travel restrictions and
other hated Ceausescu laws, lifting the dictator's orders to
destroy thousands of rural villages and move the residents into the
cities. It revokes family planning restrictions, rules on talking
to foreigners and allows Romanians unrestricted ownership of such
once-regulated items as typewriters.
   _ The Interior Ministry loses control of the security forces,
which are put under the jurisdiction of the Defense Ministry, which
controls the army. It was the army that sided with pro-democracy
protesters when revolution broke out, and security forces who
remained loyal to Ceausescu.
