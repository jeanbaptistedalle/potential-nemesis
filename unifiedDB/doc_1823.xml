   An emphysema victim died after igniting a
fire after he tried to light a cigarette while taking oxygen
through his nose, firefighters said.
   Clare Shaw, 59, of Toledo, had been warned not to smoke in bed
in his private room at the Monclova Care Center, fire investigators
said.
   Early Monday's fire was limited to Shaw's bed area, but 15 other
residents were moved as a precaution to the dining area for a
couple of hours, authorities said.
