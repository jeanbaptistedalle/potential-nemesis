   Agnes Belushi, mother of actor Jim Belushi and
the late actor John Belushi, has died. She was 64.
   Mrs. Belushi died Thursday at her home in suburban Addison after
a battle with cancer.
   She and her husband, Adam, raised their four children in
Wheaton, where Belushi owned a restaurant and Mrs. Belushi worked
in a pharmacy.
   John Belushi bought a house for his parents in California after
his fame grew from appearances on television's ``Saturday Night
Live'' and in films. The couple lived there for a short time before
returning to Illinois.
   Mrs. Belushi is survived by her husband, sons Jim and William,
and a daughter, Marian.
   Services were scheduled Saturday.
