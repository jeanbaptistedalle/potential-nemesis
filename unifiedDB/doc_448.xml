   A fire started by a space heater
swept through a mobile home, killing a woman and three children,
officials said.
   Rosa Yvonne Benton, 22, and her two daughters, 3-year-old Sara
and 11-month-old Rachel, were killed Monday in the blaze. Also
killed was Ms. Benton's 5-year-old brother, Kenneth Cureton, said
Mary Fields of the State Fire Marshals office in Fort Walton Beach.
   Ms. Benton's mother Sheila Cureton escaped from the flames with
only minor burns but was admitted to the hospital for observation,
Fields said.
   Preliminary investigations show the fire apparently was caused
by the children playing with a blanket near a hot space heater.
