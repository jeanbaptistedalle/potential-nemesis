   The merger of the Kansas City Star and
the Kansas City Times will take place March 1, the editor of the
newspapers said Thursday.
   Joe McGuff, editor and vice president, said March 1 was a good
date because it was the start of a billing cycle. Plans to merge
the morning Times and the afternoon Star were announced Oct. 5.
McGuff said the decision came about because of sagging demand for
afternoon papers and changing lifestyles.
   The newspaper, to be called the Kansas City Star, will publish
in the morning.
   McGuff said it would be larger and better organized than the
current morning newspaper. He said it would try to appeal to
readers who wish to linger over in-depth articles and those who
prefer to scan for facts.
