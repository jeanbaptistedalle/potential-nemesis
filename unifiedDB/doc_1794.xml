   Flu struck down Princess Diana, wife of the heir
to the British throne, forcing her to miss one church service over
the weekend, Buckingham Palace said.
   The princess was absent when her husband, Prince Charles,
parents-in-law Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and other
royals worshiped at the church Sunday on the family's estate in
Norfolk.
   But Diana, 28, did attend a service Christmas Day, accompanied
by sons Willliam and Harry and other family members.
   Britain has been swept by an unusually severe flu epidemic in
recent weeks.
