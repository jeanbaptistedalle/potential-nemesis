   Two gunmen robbed a jewelry district
wholesaler of nearly $1 million in gold Wednesday after handcuffing
and tying up its two owners and five employees, police said.
   The robbers carried pistols and manhandled their captives, but
the victims were not harmed. The gunmen, wearing surgical gloves,
took the gold from an open safe, put it into a briefcase and made
their getaway, the victims said.
   Khatchik Djigardjian, a co-owner of Rope Mine Corp. with his
brother Liouduig, described the robbers as a tall, Irish-looking
man who was silent and a short, bald man who spoke with an
undetermined accent.
   The loot included at least 103 pounds of fine gold, gold chains,
locks and scrap bars, Djigardjian said. An inventory would
determine the exact loss, but it was ``close to a million dollars
if not more than that,'' Djigardjian said.
   Gold closed at $406 per troy ounce in Zurich and $408.49 in Hong
Kong on Wednesday.
   Police believe about 115 pounds of gold were taken, said
Detective Manny Garcia. The detectives' report said both robbers
may have been Middle Eastern.
   A Russian Armenian who emigrated to Lebanon and then came to the
United States in 1974, Djigardjian said he has run a gold business
in the building since 1976.
