   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Glory'' and ``When Harry Met Sally ...'' scored the most honors
in Golden Globe nominations announced today by the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association.
   The two war-oriented films, one about Vietnam, the other on the
Civil War, were nominated five times each, along with the modern
romance comedy.
   They were followed by ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Do the Right
Thing'' and ``The Little Mermaid'' with four nominations apiece.
   The Golden Globes, first of the Hollywood award season, often
serve as a bellwether for the Oscars, though the foreign press
members are noted for eccentricities.

   The foreign press also makes television awards, and the leading
nominee was ``L.A. Law'' with eight. ``Cheers'' and ``Lonesome
Dove'' followed with four.

Audrey Hepburn.
