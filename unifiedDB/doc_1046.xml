   Pony rides and petting zoos exploit
animals and must be banned from public property, the city
commission decided in a move praised by animal-rights activists.
   ``I think petting zoos are terrible,'' Vice Mayor Guy Roper said
before Wednesday's vote. ``While a lot of (children) have probably
gone and petted the cute little bunnies at a petting zoo ... little
children may not realize when they grab them, they might be
breaking an ear or putting a finger in the eye.''
   Animal rights activists and members of the Humane Society of
Broward County told commissioners the ordinance would prevent some
animal abuse.
   But some people feared the ban would deprive children from
learning about animals.
   ``Most of you have had your picture taken on a pony with a
cowboy hat on. Is that going to be against the law?'' asked Henry
Harbinson.
   Commissioners gave initial approval to the ordinance, but asked
city attorney Maria Chiaro to rewrite it to make it more specific.
As approved Wednesday, the law allows animal exhibits for
``educational purposes'' only.
