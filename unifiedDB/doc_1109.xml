   President Bush vowed Thursday to press Mikhail
S. Gorbachev for freedom for Jews denied the right to emigrate from
the Soviet Union to join their families elsewhere.
   ``We'll get the job done,'' Bush promised an audience at a
ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building commemorating the
Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins Friday.
   Bush said that during the Dec. 2-3 summit with Gorbachev in
Malta, he presented the Soviet president with a list of 20
``refuseniks.''
   The first name on the list, he said, was Vladimir Raiz, whose
wife, Karmella, was present at the ceremony with Bush.
   ``Let me assure you, we'll do all in our power to free your
husband and those like him,'' Bush said.
   Gesturing toward the audience, which was sprinkled with newly
emigrated youngsters, Bush said, ``For sake of the children who are
with us today, from countries that still deny freedom of faith, we
will strive for the religious freedom their parents have never
known.''
   The Soviet Union has greatly loosened emigration restrictions in
recent years, and as a result Bush may grant that country trade
concessions denied in previous years.
