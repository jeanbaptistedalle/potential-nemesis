   Hundreds of policeman today surrounded a
Sikh temple in the northern state of Punjab and battled militants
inside, police said. At least four policeman were reported killed.
   Deputy Inspector General Gurinder Singh Bhullar said about 500
policemen surrounded the Darbar Sahib temple and exchanged fire
with entrenched extremists who had tried to ``take over the
gurdwara.''
   The gurdwara, a Punjabi-language word for Sikh temples, is in
the Tarn Taran town, 15 miles north of Amritsar where the holiest
Sikh shrine, the Golden Temple, is located.
   The government ordered an army attack on the Amritsar shrine on
June 3, 1984, to flush out Sikh extremists entrenched inside. Sikh
militants have fought since 1983 to establish a separate homeland
in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering Pakistan.
   The militants first opened fire inside the temple, ``apparently
to intimidate the clergymen,'' Bhullar said. They later fired on an
investigating police team, and ``soon it turned into a gunbattle.''
   At least four policemen were killed, reported Press Trust of
India news agency, quoting an official statement.
   The militants escaped with a wireless set, a light machinegun
and three rifles belonging to the slain policemen of the
paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force, PTI reported. But it was
unclear if the fighting had ended.
