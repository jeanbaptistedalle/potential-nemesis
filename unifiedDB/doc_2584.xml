   A fire set under cover of darkness
heavily damaged a Planned Parenthood clinic Friday, a police
official said. There were no injuries.
   Firefighters and police were called to the clinic near an
intersection with Interstate 70 in this city just east of Kansas
City at 3:15 a.m., said Sgt. Al Neinas. The fire was confined to
the building's lobby, which was destroyed.
   A flammable liquid was used to start the fire, Neinas said.
Investigators did not have suspects or a motive, he said.
   Attacks on the clinic, which does not provide abortions, have
escalated recently, according to Patty Brous, director of
development for Planned Parenthood of Kansas City. A shotgun was
fired through a window and a fire was set outside the clinic, which
has been the target of picketing, Brous said.
   The clinic provides family planning services, birth control,
pregnancy tests and treatment of sexual diseases.
