   A Briton apparently unable to remember
his name or where he comes from was discovered wandering about
northern France, police said Sunday.
   A passer-by found the man, dressed in corduroy trousers, a beige
pullover sweater and a checked parka, soaking wet on the banks of
the Somme river in the center of Abbeville, about 100 miles north
of Paris.
   The man, about 40 years old, was taken to a hospital but was
unable to remember his name or reason for being in France, police
said. Carrying no papers, he identified himself first as Richard
Davis, then Richard Jackson and could not provide his hometown.
   Police interrogated him for three days and he told them he
believed he had visited France before. He bore no sign of injury
and did not appear to be a homeless person, police said.
   French authorities contacted British officials to see whether
anyone of similar description was reported missing in Britain.
