   The Transportation Department is proposing
tougher standards for door strength in minivans, small buses and
other light-weight vehicles exempt from some automobile standards.
   The proposals announced Wednesday would subject all trucks,
buses and multipurpose vehicles with a gross weight rate of 10,000
pounds or less to the same door-strength crash tests as passenger
cars.
   ``More and more of these vehicles are being used on the nation's
highways, and we believe they should have a higher level of
protection in side-impact crashes,'' said Jerry Ralph Curry, head
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   Car doors must be built to resist the crushing force of a steel
cylinder in laboratory tests. The new rule to be effective with
1993 model trucks would go into effect after a 60-day period for
comment.
   Curry noted that sales of light trucks, mostly minivans, have
increased during the 1980s and now total 5 million a year. This has
resulted in increased injuries and deaths to occupants of such
vehicles, he said.
   The government's move drew praise from Sen. Jack Danforth,
R-Mo., principal sponsor of a bill to require stronger side impact
protection for small trucks, minivans and four-wheel drive
vehicles. The bill cleared the Senate in August and is pending in
the House.
   ``I hope for quick department action to finalize this proposal
and to build upon it,'' Danforth said. ``Most families do not
realize that minivans and other light trucks are not as safe as
passenger cars.''
