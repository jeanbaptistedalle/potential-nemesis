<HEAD>Music Syndicate Gives HBO Extension of License</HEAD>

   The music syndicate BMI agreed Friday to grant a
one-month extension of its license to Home Box Office Inc. at a
``substantially'' higher fee.
   The fee increase was not disclosed. Company officials couldn't
be reached for comment late Friday.
   BMI sued in federal court Thursday to block unauthorized use of
its songs in HBO films, a move that could throw the cable
television programmer's schedule into turmoil.
   BMI asked a U.S. District Court judge to bar HBO from
transmitting BMI songs after Sunday, when the companies' licensing
agreement ends. It noted that several films in HBO's January
schedule include BMI-copyrighted songs.
   But Judge Vincent Broderick declined to issue an immediate bar,
scheduling fuller arguments before another judge, Pierre Leval, on
Tuesday.
   The agreement came in negotiations between representatives of
the two companies, BMI said in a statement.
   BMI said the issues raised in the lawsuit are still unresolved,
and that unless the parties could reach agreement in January, the
litigation will continue.
   ``We hope that we can reach agreement on a new long-term license
in January,'' Frances W. Preston, BMI's president and chief
executive officer, said in the statement. ``But we are prepared to
take whatever action is necessary to protect the interests'' of the
100,000 songwriters, composers and music publishers it represents.
   By law, the writers and publishers are entitled to payment for
the public performance of their music.
