   Sock Shop International PLC, the high-flying
British retailer that mainly sells socks, said Friday it has
temporarily closed its 17 U.S. stores.
   The company closed the shops on Wednesday to negotiate new
leases with landlords to lower rents. It also is negotiating with a
prospective partner, said Peter Moss, a company director. He
declined to identify the possible partner.
   Fourteen of the shops are in New York City, two are in New
Jersey and one is in Philadelphia.
   Asked when the stores would be reopened, he said: ``Hopefully,
if negotiations proceed well, in the next couple of weeks, or else
there will be a further announcement in the next week or two.''
   Moss said Sock Shop's sales have suffered in the United States.
   ``It's been a disappointing trading period,'' he said. ``No I
can't put any figure on it at this point.''
   Sock Shop also operates 105 stores in Britain and 15 in
continental Europe.
   ``In the other stores, we're doing very well. We had an
excellent pre-Christmas period both in England and in France and
sales this week in the sales period are also very good,'' he said.
