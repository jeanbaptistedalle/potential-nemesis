   A man found out the hard way it's not easy
to return a pretty pink radio bought mistakenly as a Christmas
present for a roofer.
   Kenneth R. Slate, 45, began Christmas Day in jail after being
arrested Sunday night while trying to exchange the radio for one
with a more appropriate color.
   ``I got this radio for a roofer and he wouldn't want a pink
radio,'' Slate told police.
   After he opened the box and discovered the color, Slate returned
to the store. But a guard blocked his entrance, saying the store
was closing.
   As Slate persisted, the guard warned him he could be arrested.
With that, police reports say, Slate extended his arms and told the
guard to lock him up. The guard did.
   Authorities said Slate faces misdemeanor charges of criminal
trespass and disorderly conduct. He was being held on $1,000 bond.
