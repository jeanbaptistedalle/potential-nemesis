   Shivering people were moved from under tattered
blankets by police and city officials who said they would enforce
trespassing laws if the homeless return to their makeshift camp
under a downtown freeway.
   Most bundled up meager belongings Saturday and agreed to be
taken to indoor shelters. Others from the group of about a dozen
walked off, saying they would return.
   If they do, they will be given a second chance to find other
shelter, or they will be jailed for trespassing, said Bob Dean,
director of the mayor's citizen assistance office.
   ``It's damn cold under here. They shouldn't be here,'' Dean
said, adding that many of the campers need help for alcohol, drug
or medical problems.
   Dean said a lack of toilet facilities under the freeway is
causing a health hazard, and that the small fires the campers set
could spread.
