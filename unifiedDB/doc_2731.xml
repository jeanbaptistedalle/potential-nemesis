   A Greek freighter's 28-member crew worked to
keep the 600-foot ship afloat while it headed slowly to Hawaii, the
Coast Guard said.
   Sailors aboard the scrap-metal carrier Bulka, foundering about
800 miles northeast of Hawaii, used four pumps and were trying to
get a fifth started in an effort to keep the ship from sinking,
Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hubbard said Friday night.
   The Bulka was listing 6 degrees to starboard and was down 40
feet at the bow, Hubbard said. Earlier Friday, the bow had been
down only 15 feet.
   But after viewing videotape of the ship, Hubbard said, ``It
didn't look as bad as it sounds.''
   ``There's water over the bow, but the propeller is in the
water,'' he said.
   The freighter, escorted by the tanker Chevron Colorado, was
making 6 knots through low swells, Hubbard said. A Coast Guard
cutter was to replace the tanker escort this morning.
   The Bulka's Athens-based owner, Bacolistas and Sons, sent two
tugs from Honolulu to rendezvous with the freighter by Monday and
tow it, Hubbard said.
   The Bulka had been headed for South Korea with a load of scrap
metal, said Barry Arrett, captain of the Colorado.
