   Blustery cold weather and high
upper-level winds Tuesday forced Martin Marietta Corp. to postpone
its first commercial rocket launch for a sixth time.
   Wednesday's scheduled launch of the Titan 3, with British and
Japanese communications satellites aboard, has been rescheduled to
7:05 p.m. EST Thursday, said Martin Marietta spokesman Robert V.
Gordon.
   ``Air currents in the upper atmosphere are too strong'' and
recent near-freezing temperatures were too low for the Titan 3 to
be launched safely, Gordon said.
   Wednesday's lows for the Cape Canaveral area were expected to be
in the 40s, which would chill the Titan 3's solid fuel boosters to
levels that are unacceptable for launching. Temperatures ``need to
be in the 60s,'' he said.
   The rocket will carry Skynet 4A, a satellite for the British
Defense Ministry, and JCSAT-2, a satellite for the Japanese
Satellite Communications Co.
   Martin Marietta has been trying to launch the Titan 3 since Dec.
7. The company's foray into the highly competitive international
commercial space business has been delayed four times due to bad
weather and once because of a computer software problem.
