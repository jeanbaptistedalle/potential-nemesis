   Warner-Lambert Co. is recalling about
1.7 million packages of oral contraceptives because iron tablets
were misplaced in some boxes, and that could lead to unwanted
pregnancies.
   The pills were misplaced in fewer than 100 dispensers, but the
1.7 million packages of Loestrin and Norlestrin contraceptive
tablets were recalled as a precaution, the company said Sunday.
   The pills are made by its by Parke-Davis Division.
   The brown, iron tablets were placed in the first row rather than
the fourth row of the 28-pill dispensers, Warner-Lambert said. If a
woman took the seven iron tablets before taking the 21 white,
yellow, pink or green tablets, pregnancy could occur, the company
said.
   The iron tablets are placed in the packages to help women get
used to taking the pills, said spokesman Barry Cohen.
   ``Anybody who's been on the product would know something is
wrong,'' Cohen said.
   Cohen said the pills were made between one and five months ago,
and generally reach the market four to six weeks after manufacture.
