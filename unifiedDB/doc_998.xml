   The Grinches who stole Victor Diaz's van were
too busy guzzling two six-packs of beer he left on a front seat to
notice a load of Christmas toys in the back worth more than $500.
   ``My jaws dropped when I saw the toys in there,'' Diaz said
Wednesday. ``Every hair on my body went up. The officer said, `This
never happens.'''
   He had worried his family's Christmas was ruined after the van
was stolen from their driveway Monday night.
   But the only things missing when he found the van in suburban
Pacoima the next day were 12 beers, a set of wrenches, a small
stool-like table and pink bunny purse belonging to Diaz's daughter.
   Diaz had spent two hours at a toy store Monday night, buying
gifts for his four children, ages 3 to 12. He said he spent $564.
He planned to hide the toys in the garage after the childre were
asleep.
   But when he went out around 11 p.m., the van was gone.
