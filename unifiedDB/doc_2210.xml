   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange ended
sharply higher Wednesday in thin trading.
   Dealers said buying mainly reflected interest from fund managers
who wanted to add to portfolios before yearend.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 33.8
points, or 1.4 percent, higher at 2,395.8 points. Trading volume
was 223.3 million shares, down from 375.3 million shares Friday,
when the market closed early.
   Sentiment was positive on the first trading day in London after
the four-day holiday weekend. But many market players already have
closed their books for the year and moved to the sidelines until
next week.
