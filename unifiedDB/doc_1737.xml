<HEAD>De Klerk Appeals For Reconciliation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk, in a
Christmas message to the nation, urged South Africans to ``show the
world how people of different cultures can work together in
friendship.''
   In his message Sunday, De Klerk also appealed to church leaders
to work with him in trying to create ``a new, just South Africa.''
This contrasted with frequent admonitions of his predecessor, P.W.
Botha, that the clergy should stay out of politics.
   Botha quit the presidency in August after losing a power
struggle with de Klerk, who has made a series of conciliatory moves
aimed at clearing the way for negotiations with black leaders.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution that would
extend political rights to blacks, although he opposes a
one-person, one-vote system that would lead to black majority rule.
   ``We reject confrontation and conflict and seek reconciliation
and cooperation,'' he said in his nationally broadcast message.
``Let us show the world how people of different cultures can work
together in friendship and peace with mutual respect. This cannot
be achived by coercion, only by honest dialogue and negotiation.''
   He urged those who feel wronged by past events to ``put their
bitterness behind them'' and said all South Africans should ``get
to know one other better and understand each other's fears and
aspirations.''
   ``May 1990 be the foundation of a new, just South Africa,'' he
said.
