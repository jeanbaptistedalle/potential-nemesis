   There's finally light at the end of the tunnel
for a train full of sewage that was rejected from two states.
   The 61 carloads are to be unloaded at the sewage plant where
they originated, but the latest problem is cold _ it's slow work
unloading frozen sludge.
   Rejected from dumps in Louisiana and Mississippi, the train and
its 5,000 tons of waste has come home, to be returned to the Back
River Waste Treatment Plant, where the ordeal began nearly three
months ago.
   The odors that offended noses down South are now just an
unpleasant memory, as workers use jackhammers and special front-end
loaders to break up the frozen cargo to meet a state-imposed
deadline of Dec. 31 for disposal of the sludge.
   George G. Balog, director of the city's Public Works Department,
said Thursday that the sludge would be stored temporarily in the
Back River ``winter storage lagoon,'' then disinfected and
partially retreated for combining with the plant's normal output of
waste.
