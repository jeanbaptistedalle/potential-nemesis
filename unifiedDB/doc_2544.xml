   Presiding Bishop J.O. Patterson Sr. of the
Church of God in Christ, who retired earlier this year in failing
health, died Friday. He was 77.
   Patterson, leader of the church's 3.7 million members around the
world, died about 6 a.m. at William F. Bowld Hospital in Memphis,
said Elaine Newsome, spokeswoman of the denomination.
   Patterson was first elected presiding bishop of the church, the
world's largest black pentecostal holiness denomination, in 1968.
   He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in April but refused to
be treated for the disease because, he said, ``The treatment of
prayer is better than chemotherapy.''
   Doctors in the spring thought Patterson would die by October,
said David Hall, editor of the denomination's newspaper, Whole
Truth.
   The bishop's family was working on memorial arrangements Friday
morning, the church said.
