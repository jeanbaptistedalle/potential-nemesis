   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _ Thousands of U.S. troops moved into the capital on the second
day of their offensive. They encountered sporadic firing but U.S.
officials said their forces were in control.
   _ President Bush said the military operation was ``open ended,''
indicating it would last as long as necessary to capture Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega and restore order in Panama.
   _ New President Guillermo Endara addressed the legislative
assembly, under heavy U.S. guard. He said he would welcome back
members of Noriega's forces who support democracy.
   _ U.S. troops surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies with
armored personnel carriers, following rumors that Noriega may have
fled there. In response, Nicaraguan troops in armored cars and
tanks surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Managua.
   _ A $1 million bounty offer led to a flood of tips and rumors on
Noriega's whereabouts. Callers placed him in numerous locations in
Panama and in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Israeli
television reported he had been seen on the luxurious island of
Contadora off Panama's coast and that he was planning to escape to
Nicaragua.
   _ Hundreds of stores in Panama City were looted, and their goods
were sold on the streets of the city's slums.
   _ The U.S. military reported 21 soldiers and the wife of one
U.S. serviceman were killed, 208 wounded and four missing. U.S.
officials said 59 Panamanian soldiers had been killed and 66
wounded. A doctor at a Panama City hospital said 80 dead and about
1,000 injured were brought there; he could give no breakdown of
civilian and military.
