   Here is a brief summary of events in Romania:
   _The 24-year reign of President Nicolae Ceausescu collapsed as a
citizen uprising was joined by rebellious troops. A top defense
official who joined the rebels said they controlled most of the
country, with only scattered resistance.
   _Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled the presidential palace by
helicopter. Some reports said they had been arrested; others
indicated their whereabouts were unknown.
   _Ceausescu's son, the interior minister, the chief of the secret
police and other key figures of the regime were arrested.
   _Fighting continued into Saturday between rebel troops and
security forces loyal to Ceausescu in Bucharest and elsewhere in
the country.
   _Hundreds were reported killed in the fighting, in addition to
the thousands believed killed earlier in the week of unrest.
   _A National Salvation Committee was formed to run the country
temporarily.
   _Jubilant Romanians rallied in Bucharest and throughout the
country.
   _Hundreds of people dug up mass graves near Timisoara, in
western Romania, in search of as many as 4,500 people killed last
weekend when protesters were massacred by security forces.
   _The Bush administration said a ``terrible burden'' had been
lifted from the Romanian people and expressed hope for a peaceful
transition to democracy.
   _The European Community foreign ministers pledged immediate aid
to Romania and the Red Cross in Geneva flew four tons of medical
supplies to Bucharest.
