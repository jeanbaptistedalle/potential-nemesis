   Two tour buses crashed head-on before
dawn Friday on a rainy stretch of the Pacific Highway between
Sydney and Brisbane, leaving at least 32 people dead in Australia's
worst road crash ever, police said.
   New South Wales state police superidentent Merv Lane said some
passengers still were trapped inside one of the coaches more than
five hours after the 3:30 a.m. accident in Fredrickton, about 280
north of Sydney. Forty people were hospitalized.
   The crash occurred two months after a bus and a tractor-trailer
collided at nearby Grafton, killing 20 people. The Pacific Highway
is considered one of Australia's most dangerous roads.
   Witnesses said the two buses involved in Friday's accident were
embedded in one another. Television footage showed bodies lining
both sides of the road.
   ``It's dreadful, there are people hanging from the bus
windows,'' said Marion Thomas, who lives near the scene and was
awakened by the sound of the crash. ``It was a terrible explosion.
It's a terrible sight.''
   It was not immediately known if any foreigners were aboard the
buses, though police, which downgraded the original death toll from
40, said it was believed all aboard were Australian.
   Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
