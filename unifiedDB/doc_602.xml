<UNK>FTC Clears Icahn to Acquire Bigger Stake in USX Corp.</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal antitrust regulators have cleared
investor Carl C. Icahn to acquire a bigger stake in USX Corp., the
Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.
   The agency said it had granted Icahn early termination of the
waiting period required under federal law to ensure that certain
mergers and acquisitions do not violate antitrust law.
   Icahn, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, also owns
Trans World Airlines Inc.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last
month, Icahn revealed he was seeking FTC permission to acquire at
least 25 percent of USX, a Pittsburgh-based steel and energy
company.
   FTC clearance for such an acquisition is required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
   The FTC announced Icahn's acquisition of USX was among the
transactions granted clearance, or early termination from the
waiting period. No other information was provided by the FTC.
   USX spokesman William Kessler declined to comment on Icahn's
filing.
   Icahn was in meetings Tuesday, his secretary said. He did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.
   Icahn's November SEC filing showed he owned nearly 34 million,
or 13.26 percent, of USX's outstanding shares of common stock. The
document said Icahn intended to acquire more than 15 percent of
USX's voting securities ``and, depending upon market conditions,
more than 25 percent'' of its voting securities.
   The filing said the acquisition was dependent on market
conditions and redemption or invalidation of a ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan adopted by USX on Oct. 10 in an attempt to
ward off a hostile takeover.
