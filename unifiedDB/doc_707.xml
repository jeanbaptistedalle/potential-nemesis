<HEAD>Former Black Panther Leader Gets Probation in Bad-Check Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Bobby Seale has been put
on probation for a year for writing bad checks in a financially
disastrous venture to sell ribs at a barbecue festival.
   Seale, 52, also was fined $1,000 Tuesday and ordered to serve
100 hours of community service.
   He pleaded guilty Nov. 20 to four misdemeanor counts after being
charged with passing bad checks for more than $10,700 in ribs,
lodging and other expenses for his booth at Cleveland's National
Rib Cook-Off in 1988.
   ``I had no intention whatsoever to defraud,'' he told Common
Pleas Judge William Aurelius. ``I have a son in college ... I rent.
I've been trying to take care of my family. I do all kinds of
community service.''
   Aurelius noted that Seale has paid off his approximately $11,000
debt, which Seale said resulted from poor sales and
higher-than-expected expenses.
   Seale was co-founder of the radical Black Panthers in the 1960s
and was arrested with the Chicago Seven for allegedly conspiring to
incite the 1968 riots outside the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
   Seale helps teach disadvantaged youngsters to rebuild abandoned
houses in Philadelphia, where he is a community liaison for Temple
University, his lawyer said.
