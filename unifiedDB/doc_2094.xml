<HEAD>Nicaragua Prohibits U.S. Supply Plane From Landing</HEAD>

   The Nicaraguan government will not
allow a U.S. plane carrying supplies for its embassy to land as
scheduled next month, the official newspaper Barricada reported
today.
   Barricada, the organ of the ruling Sandinista Front, said the
monthly flight that supplies the U.S. Embassy is scheduled to
arrive Jan. 11.
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto informed U.S. Secretary of
State James A. Baker III on Tuesday night that the measure was
taken because U.S. forces would not allow Nicaraguan planes to land
in Panama and had surrounded the Nicaraguan Embassy in Panama City,
Barricada said.
   Civil aviation was halted in Panama when U.S. forces invaded
last week to oust dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega. U.S. troops
later surrounded the Nicaraguan, Cuban and Libyan embassies to
prevent Noriega from seeking refuge there. Noriega chose instead to
seek refuge in the Vatican embassy.
   Last week, Nicaraguan troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in
Managua in response to the blockade of the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Panama.
   Barricada said about 165 Nicaraguans and two Aeronica planes
have been trapped in Panama since the Dec. 20 invasion.
   It quoted the Foreign Ministry as demanding that the Nicaraguans
and the Nicaraguan planes be permitted to leave today and said the
U.S. supply plane would not be allowed to land before Jan. 26 if
the demands were not met.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Lou Falino, contacted by telephone, said
he had no comment on the matter.
