   A man working for an airport caterer was
charged with falsely reporting that a bomb had been planted on a
plane bound for Chicago, state police said.
   Robert J. Shinkle, 23, of Springfield, Mass., was charged Monday
with falsely reporting an incident and breach of peace, said
Detective James Allen.
   Shinkle was overheard saying as he stocked food on United
Airlines Flight 509 for a Christmas Day flight to Chicago that the
airplane would blow up in flight, police said. Passengers had not
boarded the plane at Bradley International Airport when he
allegedly made his comments, and the flight was delayed more than
an hour, police said.
   Police searched the plane with a bomb-sniffing dog but found
nothing.
   Shinkle, of Dobbs Catering Service, was to be arraigned Jan. 8,
police said.
