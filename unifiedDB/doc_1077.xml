   Re-establishing law and order in
Panama is the next objective of the U.S. military but the capture
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga remains a priority, a top military
planner said Thursday.
   ``As long as Noriega is floating around, there are going to be
some people who will not accept'' the government of President
Guillermo Endara, said Lt. Col. Bill Bennett.
   ``We want to capture this guy and get him to Miami,'' Bennett
said. ``There are ongoing efforts to locate General _ I'm sorry,
Mr. _ Noriega.''
   Bennett, chief of contingency plans for the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama, said he could not estimate the strength of
remaining forces loyal to Noriega but that they remain mostly in
outlying towns where U.S. troops have yet to go.
   ``We've got to re-establish law and order throughout Panama
City,'' Bennett said.
   The plan, he said, is to identify leaders who will be loyal to
the Endara government and then get a Panamanian police force in
action.
   ``We are interested in doing what the Endara government will
(need to) succeed,'' Bennett told reporters.
   There are about 1,500 U.S. military police already in Panama
with another 1,500 en route to ``help with law and order,'' Bennett
said.
   Bennett predicted that more Panamanian military units that
``have been sitting on the fence'' will soon support the Endara
government.
   ``But that is where the capture of Noriega does become
important,'' he said. ``We don't want to give them any sort of
cause to rally to the other side.''
