   Stiff high altitude winds forced an
eighth postponement Friday night of the launch of Martin Marietta's
first commercial Titan 3 rocket carrying British and Japanese
communications satellites.
   When the countdown reached the five-minute mark, the launch team
held it there for nearly an hour while officials assessed
last-minute data received from weather balloons.
   With the shear winds about 30,000 feet up still too high, the
effort was called off once again. The launch was rescheduled for
7:07 p.m. Saturday.
   Liftoff originally was scheduled Dec. 7, but technical and
weather problems, mainly high winds, have caused repeated delays.
   The rocket is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
the Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British Ministry
for Defence.
