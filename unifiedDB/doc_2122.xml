   A rapist who called himself a vampire and
drank a victim's blood is suspected in at least six slayings, and
prosecutors are trying to build a murder case against him before he
gets out of prison.
   ``I don't feel comfortable with him being in our community,''
State Attorney Norm Wolfinger said of ``vampire rapist'' John
Crutchley. ``The only crime we've proven him of is reason enough.''
   Crutchley's former lawyer, Joe Mitchell, said he tried to work
out a plea bargain in which Crutchley would have admitted to up to
six murders and led investigators to the burial sites. But the
talks broke down.
   Wolfinger said Tuesday the informal negotiations broke down
because the state could not produce solid evidence linking
Crutchley to any deaths.
   ``There comes a point in the negotiations when the state has to
show something,'' the prosecutor said. ``If we had had anything to
tie a charge to, we would have done it. But we had nothing.''
   Crutchley, a former engineer, pleaded guilty in 1986 to raping a
19-year-old woman and was sentenced to 25 years in prison.
Prosecutors agreed to drop several other charges, including robbing
the woman of nearly half her blood.
   With time off for good behavior, Crutchley could be out of
prison by 1992.
   Doctors saihey have long suspected him in the deaths of at
least six women in Brevard County _ five victims whose bodies were
discovered in 1985 and another woman who disappeared.
   But Wolfinger said his strategy was ``to get him in prison and
continue the investigation of the homicides.''
   ``We will continue to work these cases as hard as we can,'' he
said.
