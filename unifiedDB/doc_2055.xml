   The dollar remained weak against the yen Wednesday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moved to a new high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
257.69 points Tuesday, added another 120.32 points, or 0.31
percent, to close at 38,801.63.
   The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.27 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.37 yen. After opening at 142.13 yen, the currency
ranged between 141.85 yen and 142.20 yen.
   Currency dealers described the trading as thin, with fewer
participants due to the holiday season.
   A dealer with Mitsui Bank said there was sporadic buying of
European currencies, especially the West German mark, through
dollar selling, but the buying was not enough to direct the U.S.
currency.
   Some investors sold the dollar to buy yen, but ``the dollar
remained close to its opening,'' said the dealer, who spoke
anonymously.
   Other dealers said many market players expected a further
narrowing of gaps in interest rates between Japan and the United
States.
   On Monday, the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, raised
its official discount rate to 4.25 percent from 3.75 percent to
stem inflationary pressure in Japan.
   A higher discount rate, the rate the central bank charges on its
loans to commercial banks, tends to boost the value of the yen
against the dollar.
   The U.S. discount rate is 7 percent.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to gain with
shares being bought on a broad front, encouraged by the yen's
firmness against the dollar, securities dealers said.
