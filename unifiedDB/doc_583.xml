   Michael Quinlan, president and chief executive of
McDonald's Corp., will became chairman of the world's biggest
restaurant company on March 31, McDonald's announced today.
   Chairman Fred L. Turner, 56, will become senior chairman and
continue as chairman of the executive committee, McDonald's said in
a statement.
   Quinlan, 45, will head a relatively youthful senior management
team which also includes Ed Rensi, 45, president of McDonald's USA,
and Jim Cantalupo, 46, president of the company's international
operations.
   In a statement, Turner said the move ``positions our senior
management well for the 90s.''
   ``I will continue to participate with them as we strive to
develop the McDonald's system to its potential,'' he said.
   Quinlan has spent 26 years with the fast-food leader, which is
based in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook and has 11,000 restaurants
in more than 50 countries.
   ``We are a unique and special company,'' he said in a statement.
``I am excited and optimistic about continuing and furthering the
tradition of excellence that our company has always represented.''
