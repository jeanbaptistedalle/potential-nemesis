   The losers in a medical malpractice
trial claim in a request for a new trial that an episode of the TV
series ``L.A. Law'' influenced the jurors to vote against them.
   In a motion filed Friday, a lawyer representing a man whose wife
died after a 1981 gallbladder operation suggested jurors were
influenced by the Dec. 7 episode, which portrayed a doctor
wrongfully accused of malpractice.
   The jury in the case of widower Jacob Klein vs. Drs. Harvey O.
Kaiser and Theodore D. Aylward decided on Dec. 8 that the doctors
were not at fault in the death of Lillian Klein.
   ``The show was pure and simple propaganda for doctors defending
malpractice cases,'' said the motion filed on Klein's behalf by
Miami lawyer David F. Ennis.
   ``In effect, the defendant(s) had substantial additional time
for argument made through trained, sympathetic, well-liked,
well-known actors,'' the motion said.
   ``It is highly probable, and more likely than not, in light of
`L.A. Law's' nationwide popularity, that one or more jurors viewed
this segment ... or even discussed same among them,'' Ennis
concluded.
   Tampa lawyer William Hahn, who defended Aylward, said he thought
the motion was humorous.
   Three members of the jury reached Friday by telephone said the
show had no effect on their verdict, the Tampa Tribune reported
Saturday. All said the show was not mentioned by others during
deliberations.
   ``I started to watch it and I fell asleep,'' said juror
Christine Wallace.
   Pat Schultz, corporate spokeswoman for NBC in Los Angeles, said
company officials know of no court case that had to be retried
because of ``L.A. Law.''
