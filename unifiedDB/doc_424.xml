   The National Organization for Women is kicking up
a fuss over plans to lead off the Cotton Bowl Parade with 995 pairs
of women's legs.
   The local chapter is circulating a petition objecting to the use
of ``sex appeal and chauvinism'' in promoting the New Year's Day
parade, which will begin with members of the National Cheerleaders
Association Dance-Drill Team.
   ``We just want to raise awareness,'' local NOW spokeswoman Karen
Ashmore said Monday. ``We have valuable contributions to make to
society other than legs.''
   Paul Gleiser, executive director of the parade, called the
petition drive an overreaction.
   ``It's a parade,'' he said. ``It goes down the street and little
kids sitting on their dad's shoulders get excited.''
   ``Do we start eliminating these women from the parade?'' said H.
Ward Lay, chairman of the Cotton Bowl Parade Pageantry Committee.
``We just happen to be the parade that has the most beautiful women
in it, but we also just happen to be in the city that has the most
beautiful women in it, and the state, too.''
   ``If they're upset, I'm indeed sorry,'' Lay said. ``But the
parade will go on in its form and not be changed.''
