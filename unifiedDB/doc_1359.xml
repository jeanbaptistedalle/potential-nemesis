   The U.S. ambassador to Panama, Arthur Davis,
has authorized $25,000 to purchase food and medicine for needy
Panamanians, the State Department said Friday.
   In addition, as part of the restoration of normal relations with
Panama, the Treasury Department released $100,000 in Panamanian
funds which had been frozen in the United States, department
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   The frozen funds were to be turned over to President Guillermo
Endara for payment of salaries, officials said. The $25,000 came
from a fund the embassy maintains for emergency situations, Boucher
said.
   Panama's assets in the United States were frozen last year. The
total is estimated at $371 million.
   Meanwhile, Panama's new ambassador to Washington, Carlos
Rodriguez, moved into the embassy on Friday. The keys to the
mission were turned over to him by a State Department official in
late afternoon.
   The embassy was shut down Sept. 1, the date on which the term of
office expired of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. The Bush
administration regarded Delvalle as Panama's legitimate authority
even though he had been ousted in February 1988.
