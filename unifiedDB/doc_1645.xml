   A malfunctioning state lottery computer
allowed sales for 10 minutes after the winning numbers were drawn
and customers helped themselves to more than 250 winning tickets,
officials said.
   Lottery officials, however, said a backup computer caught the
error and recorded which tickets were sold after the drawing. The
late tickets will not be honored, and officials may prosecute those
who try to collect on them as well as revoke licenses from the
agents who sold them, said state lottery director Otho Brown.
   ``Its the worst problem I've ever had,'' Brown said.
   As much as $600,000 in fraudulent winning tickets may be in
circulation, Brown said. While some were cashed, he predicted the
losses will be limited to between $30,000 and $60,000.
   The tickets were in the ``Play 3'' game, which pays $250 for the
winning numbers in correct order, and ``Play 4,'' which pays $2,500.
   ``Somewhere the system burped and nobody saw it,'' said Finance
Secretary Stephen T. Golding.
   The problem occurred when the computer system's clock
malfunctioned and the computer failed to stop selling for
Thursday's games at 6:56 p.m., two minutes before the drawing.
Sales were allowed to continue for 12 minutes until the problem was
discovered and the computer was shut down manually, officials said.
   Brown said Control Data Corp., which runs the computer system
for the Delaware lottery, has acknowledged its liability.
