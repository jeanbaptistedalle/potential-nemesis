   Hyundai Motor America on Friday recalled 242,972
1986 and 1987 model Excel automobiles for emission-control repairs.
   Excels involved were not sold in California. Without the work
they could fail emissions tests required in many states, Hyundai
said.
   Excel owners will be notified by mail and may take their cars to
a Hyundai dealer for the service, which will be free of charge and
take about one hour, the company said.
   The repairs include modifying the choke system, installing a new
carburetor jet, enlarging a port in the air cleaner and resetting
ignition timing.
   The recall represented more than half of Hyundai's total sales
of 432,492 cars for 1986-87. That figure includes all models, and
includes California sales.
