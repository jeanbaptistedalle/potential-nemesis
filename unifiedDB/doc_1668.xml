   An Air Force C-5 cargo plane left the United
States for Panama on Sunday carrying 32,000 pounds of emergency
medical supplies for Panama's new government, the Pentagon said.
   The plane left from Charleston, S.C., in the first of what the
Pentagon said likely will be several airlifts of medical supplies
to Panama.
   The supplies are to be turned over to the U.S.-installed Endara
government for the treatment of Panamanians injured in the U.S.
invasion or in subsequent fighting, the Pentagon said.
