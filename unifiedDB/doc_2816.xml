   A strong earthquake, measuring 6.7 on the
Richter Scale, occurred near the northern coast of Papua New
Guinea, the U.S. Geological Survey reported Saturday.
   The tremor occurred at 9:19 a.m. Sunday, local time, or 6:19
p.m. EST Saturday, the federal agency said.
   Donald Finley, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, said
it was not known whether there were any injuries or serious damage.
A quake of similar magnitude in April, 1988 in roughly the same
area did not cause serious injuries or damage, he said.
   The agency said Sunday's tremor occurred near the coast and it's
not known how much of it was on land or in the water.
   The agency's earthquake monitoring facility at Golden, Colo.,
measured the tremor at 6.7 on the Richter scale and placed it at
420 miles northwest of Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New
Guinea.
   The area is known to have frequent tremors. Sunday's earthquake
was the strongest in the region since the 6.7 magnitude earthquake
that occurred on April 8, 1988, officials said.
