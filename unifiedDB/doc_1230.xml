   The first outbreaks of the 1989-90 flu season
have been reported in a Colorado day-care center and a Minnesota
nursing home, the national Centers for Disease Control said.
   Twenty-four children in the day-care center became ill in
November, and a test performed on one child found the influenza
type researchers know as A-H3N2, one of the three major flu types,
the CDC said Thursday.
   Then, during the week of Dec. 4, an outbreak began in the
Minnesota nursing home, eventually spreading to four residents and
two employees. A test found the same kind of influenza again.
   The CDC noted that all of the A-H3N2 influenza viruses it has
tested this winter are the ``Shanghai'' flu, which the current flu
vaccine protects against.
   In all, sporadic flu cases have been reported in 19 states. A
few cases of a different strain of flu have been found. They
resemble the ``Taiwan'' flu, which the vaccine also protects
against.
   The CDC recommends flu vaccine, especially for people at
increased risk of complications from influenza, including the
elderly and those with heart or lung trouble.
