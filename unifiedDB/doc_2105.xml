   A work crew Christmas weekend was
assigned to do nothing but flush the 503 toilets at the Gator Bowl
to prevent a freeze-up at the stadium before the annual New Year's
college football game.
   A freeze in 1983 caused about $400,000 damage in broken water
pipes, so when record cold headed for town last week, officials
hired a crack brigade of toilet flushers to keep water moving
through the plumbing.
   From dusk Friday until noon on Christmas, the 23-member crew
flushed toilets. Each person was responsible for an average of 21.8
toilets each.
   Everything went fine until a power outage shut down stadium
water pumps on Saturday and Sunday. The stadium sustained about
$5,000 damage to plumbing.
   ``When the pumps weren't working and the water pressure was bad,
there wasn't much you could do,'' said sports complex manager
Richard Fagan.
