<HEAD>Father Finds Tape of Drug Deals in Recorder Intended as Christmas
Gift</HEAD>

   A father hoping to surprise his children
with a tape recorder for Christmas got a surprise of his own _ the
device contained a tape of conversations involving drug dealing.
   An Indianapolis man purchased the recorder at a Wal-Mart store
in Plainfield Dec. 23, said Hendricks County Sheriff's Department
spokesman Lt. Stephen G. Golden.
   The man, whose identity was withheld, noticed the tape inside
the player and listened to it. He then turned the tape over to
authorities.
   The tape was made secretly by parents of a Bridgeport teen-ager
when they suspected their daughter was dealing drugs, Golden said.
The parents used a home recording device that began taping whenever
the phone was used.
   Investigators believe the girl learned of the recording and she
or her boyfriend took the tape to the store to play, leaving it in
a display model, Golden said.
   When the recorder was the only one left, employees boxed it and
sold it to the Indianapolis man, who took it home, Golden said.
   ``The guy was shocked because it was supposed to be a present
from Santa Claus'' to his children, said Golden.
   Detectives listened to the tape and have seven suspects to
question, Golden said. The tape is recorded so clearly that
detectives may be able to trace the telephone's touch-tone sounds.
   The tape describes plans by dealers to distribute illicit drugs
in at least three counties, Golden said.
   ``We've picked out first names and have figured out who these
people are,'' said Golden. ``We've identified several of them.''
