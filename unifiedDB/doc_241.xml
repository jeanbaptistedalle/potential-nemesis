<HEAD>Bush Signs Bill Raising Vets' Benefits 4.7 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill that grants a 4.7 percent increase in
benefits to 2.2 million veterans and dependents was signed into law
by President Bush on Monday.
   The measure also provides the increase to 312,000 surviving
spouses and children of veterans and matches the cost-of-living
adjustment that Social Security beneficiaries and veterans
pensioners are receiving this month.
   ``Our nation provides compensation and other monetary benefits
to service-disabled veterans and dependency and indemnity
compensation benefits to the survivors of those who died as a
result of military service to our country,'' Bush said in a
statement. ``My administration is committed to ensuring that these
payments keep pace with changes in the cost of living.''
   The bill includes:
   _A modest increase in use fees for the veterans' housing loan
guaranty program, which has provided home financing for more than
13 million veterans since the end of World War II.
   _An extension of the program for helping states colnstruct
facilities for veterans care ;and a program in which VA contracts
with halfway houses for care of homeless, chronically mentally ill
veterans.
