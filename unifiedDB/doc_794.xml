   The chief drug control strategists for the
United States and France said after a meeting Wednesday that they
will join in the fight against drugs even though they face
different kinds of problems.
   ``The drug problem in France is essentially linked to heroin,''
Georgina Dufoix said after a meeting with William J. Bennett,
director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   ``Cocaine has not so far penetrated our territory as much as we
feared it would,'' she said in comments made through a translator.
   Bennett said the discussion focused on Ms. Dufoix's questions on
U.S. efforts _ ``What's going on here, what works, what we're
seeing.''
   ``She admitted France is quite concerned about its problems,''
Bennett said. ``It appears that they've been growing as the drug
criminals try to extend their reach and build their markets.''
   Bennett said he expected to continue the discussion with Ms.
Dufoix ``perhaps in France later next year.''
