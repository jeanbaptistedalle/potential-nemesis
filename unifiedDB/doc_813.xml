   About 150 people outraged by the reported
massacre of demonstrators in Romania protested outside its embassy
here Wednesday, with some hurling stones and bottles of ink before
being stopped by police.
   Police otherwise did not hamper the protesters, who lighted
candles in the shape of a cross on the sidewalk outside the
embassy, hanged protest posters on its wrought-iron fence and
chanted ``Ceausescu Go Away,'' referring to Romanian Communist
ruler Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``Romania, Rise Up,'' said one poster.
   A minute-long throwing attack by a handful of protesters left
the white embassy walls mottled by black ink. At least one window
was broken.
   The attack ended and the rally proceeded peacefully after a
policeman ordered demonstrators to behave themselves. A member of
the Polish Socialist Party gave a speech condemning Romania for
firing on its people during weekend demonstrations directed against
Ceausescu.
   In another development, the Romanian ambassador was summoned to
the Foreign Ministry to hear complaints about ``brutal treatment''
of Polish tourists by Romanian border guards, the state PAP news
agency reported.
   Poland and Romania are Warsaw Pact allies, but relations with
the hard-line communist state have been chilly since Solidarity
took over the Polish government in August.
