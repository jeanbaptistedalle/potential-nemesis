   Two public officials who defied the
Supreme Court by leading a prayer before a high school football
game in August have decided not to fight the case in court.
   Mayor Emory Folmar and Montgomery County Commission Chairman
William Joseph agreed not to conduct prayers before high school
football games, saying the school board has control over pregame
activities at the city-owned stadium.
   The reponse Wednesday by Folmar and Joseph to civil libertarians
who filed a lawsuit over the pre-game prayers leaves only a slim
chance that the case will go to trial as scheduled Jan. 4,
attorneys said.
   ``I think they've done the responsible thing,'' David Schoen, a
Montgomery attorney who filed the suit, said Thursday.
   A federal judge last month dismissed the Montgomery County Board
of Education from the case because it agreed not to sanction or
permit prayers before school-sponsored events. Folmar and Joseph
said they would honor that agreement.
   ``It's not a question of saying we were wrong or they were wrong
or the world is wrong,'' said Folmar. ``We in effect were stopped
from doing it by the school board.''
