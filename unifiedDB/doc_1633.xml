   A freighter picked up six Cuban refugees floating
southeast of Key Largo on Saturday, then handed them over to the
Coast Guard, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
   The Santa Paula, a 500-foot West German freighter en route to
Venezuela, came upon the six men late in the morning, according to
Senior Chief Petty Officer Lou Parris.
   The freighter changed course at the Coast Guard's request, and
handed the Cubans over to a Coast Guard vessel at the Miami Harbor
sea buoy late in the day, Parris said.
   The Cubans were taken to the Coast Guard's Miami Beach base,
where they were interviewed by Immigration and Naturalization
Service officials.
   All six appeared to be suffering from exposure after the chilly
crossing, but otherwise were in good health, Parris said.
   The spokesman did not know what sort of craft the Cubans were
aboard when found or how far they were from Key Largo when the
freighter found them.
   Key Largo, the northernmost of the Florida Keys, is about 60
miles south of Miami.
