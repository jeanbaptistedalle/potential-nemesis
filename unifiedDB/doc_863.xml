<HEAD>Baker Discusses Different Supports for Democracy</HEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AM) _ The Soviet Union is supporting democracy by
not interfering in other countries while the United States, this
time, is supporting democracy by sending troops into another
country, Secretary of State James A. Baker III noted Wednesday.
   In discussing the Soviet criticism of the U.S. attack on the
forces of dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Baker said:
   ``Let me say that I think both the United States and the Soviet
Union today are supporting democracy. At least that's what
President Gorbachev told President Bush at Malta when he said he
had a little problem with the use of the word democratic _ I mean,
`Western values,' so we agreed that we would you use the term
`democratic values.'
   ``The difference is that the Soviet Union supports democracy by
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to proceed.
In this one and very unique instance, the United States did it by
going in to assist a democratically elected government against a
dictator.''
   There have been many reports from Eastern Europe crediting
Gorbachev's refusal to support local Communist parties for the
dramatic emergence of non-Communist governments in several capitals.
   Noriega overturned the results of an election this year in which
Panama citizens voted for Guillermo Endara for president on May 7.
Noriega-formed ``Dignity Battalions'' beat opposition candidates in
the streets.
