<HEAD>Dollar Up, Nikkei Sets Another Record High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar inched up against the yen Thursday,
while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at another
record high.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues added 75.31
points, or 0.19 percent, to close at 38,876.94 points. It had
gained 120.32 points Wednesday and closed at the previous record
high of 38,801.63.
   The dollar closed at 142.15 yen, up 0.05 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 142.10 yen. After opening at 142.00 yen, the dollar
ranged between 141.99 yen and 142.17 yen.
   Currency dealers said the dollar remained in a narrow range in
thin trading, normal for a holiday season.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously, said the
dollar should move lower early next year in anticipation of a
further decline in U.S. interest rates, which have been speculated
about in recent weeks.
   Lower interest rates tend to erode the value of a nation's
currency.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index lost its earlier gains,
with profit-taking selling in midmorning outpacing small-lot buying
during early trading, securities dealers said. The index had gained
65.01 points shortly after the market opened.
   ``The index was pushed back by profit-taking, small-lot selling,
by institutional investors,'' said Nomura Securities' Toshinao
Nakamura.
   Other dealers said some investors retreated to the sidelines
ahead of the New Year's holiday.
