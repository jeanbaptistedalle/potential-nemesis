   Firefighters insist the man they pulled out
of a chimney Saturday wasn't really auditioning for Santa Claus'
job, he was just trying to get home in time for Christmas.
   The 20-year-old man's family was locked out of their house in
the Sherman Oaks section of Los Angeles. They decided the best way
to get inside was for him to go down the chimney, said city Fire
Department spokesman Jim Wells.
   The victim, who was not identified, was about halfway down when
he got stuck, Wells said.
   Firefighters used a sledgehammer and a battering ram to poke a
hole in the chimney, then pulled him out, the spokesman said. The
man escaped with minor scratches.
