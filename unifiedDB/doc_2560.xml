   Army troops have arrested 86 people,
bulldozed 20 houses and seized heavy weapons in a sweep of
Pakistan's frontier arms-trading town of Darra, officials said
Friday.
   The District Magistrate's office said anti-aircraft guns,
artillery, rocket launchers, drugs and counterfeit money were among
the items seized.
   Officials said the action by Pakistan's Frontier Corps was
prompted by the recent kidnapping of an official's 3-year-old son
and of another official who tried to arrest the suspect.
   The troops, some in armored personnel carriers, moved in and
freed the two, razed 20 houses belonging to alleged criminals and
arrested 86 people on various charges, officials said.
   Darra, seated in rocky tribal land about 35 miles from the
border of Afghanistan, has a booming cottage industry of producing
and copying firearms.
   But since the beginning of the Afghan civil war in 1978, it has
also expanded into open but illegal sales of sophisticated
weaponry, heroin and other contraband.
   Although officially off-limits to foreigners, its customers are
known to include Afghan rebels and extremist groups from India.
