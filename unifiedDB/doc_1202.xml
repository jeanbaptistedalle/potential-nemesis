   Braniff Inc., which filed for bankruptcy
protection this fall, announced Thursday a net loss for the quarter
ended Oct. 31 of $134.9 million, compared with a $7.8 million loss
in the year-earlier period.
   The net loss per share for the quarter was $9.15, compared with
a loss of 59 cents per share in the quarter ended Oct. 31, 1988.
   Operating revenues for the airline for the quarter totaled $98.9
million, down from $127.5 million for the same quarter in 1988.
   Braniff's consolidated operating loss for the quarter was $40.4
million, compared with a loss of $10.9 million in the quarter a
year ago.
   Orlando-based Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from creditors on Sept. 28 and substantially reduced its scheduled
passenger service.
   On Nov. 6, Braniff suspended all scheduled flights. It remains a
charter carrier.
