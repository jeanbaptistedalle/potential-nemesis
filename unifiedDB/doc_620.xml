   A descendant of Campbell Soup Co. founder John
T. Dorrance Sr. said Tuesday she is re-evaluating her stock
position with other family members following the dissolution of
their 26.5 percent voting trust.
   Hope H. van Beuren disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that since reacquiring voting power over her
7.9 million Campbell shares, she and other family members are
discussing what to do with their stock.
   While Mrs. van Beuren said she had ``no present plans or
proposals'' the discussions have included the possibility of a
merger, reorganization or liquidation of all or part of the Camden,
N.J., food company.
   Also under discussion, according to the SEC filing, are the
possible sale or transfer of some or all of Campbell's assets.
   Dorrance family members control about 58 percent of Campbell
stock.
   But the family has maintained, since the death of John ``Jack''
Dorrance Jr., that it would vote its shares in a single block.
   Earlier this month, however, family members voted to dissolve
the voting trust, created in 1987, that controlled a 26.5 percent
stake of the company.
   The news spurred investor speculation that the company would be
sold, at a time when Campbell's board of directors is looking for a
successor to president R. Gordon McGovern, who resigned last month.
