   Snow was scattered from coast to coast across the northern
states Thursday, and temperatures were closer to seasonable levels
than during the last couple of weeks.
   At midday, snow was reported in parts of western Washington
state, southwestern Oregon, the Idaho Panhandle, northern Montana,
western North Dakota, northeastern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin,
Michigan, eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, New York state, and
northern and central Maine.
   Despite Thursday's snow, a temperature inversion over Washington
state has put warmer air at high elevations and precipitation fell
as rain in the mountains, meaning only a few of the state's ski
resorts have been able to open.
   The heaviest snowfall during the six hours up to noon included 3
inches at Syracuse, N.Y., and 2 inches at Duluth and Hibbing,
Minn., and Havre, Mont.
   About 2 inches of snow fell across northern Wisconsin during the
morning and an additional 2 to 4 inches of snow was expected.
   No record low temperatures were reported Thursday, a marked
change after a month in which more than 700 records were broken or
tied, the National Weather Service said.
   There were no reports of significant rainfall during the six
hours up to noon, although rain extended from west-central Texas
across south-central Texas.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 15 degrees below zero
at Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 3
degrees at Houlton and Limestone, Maine, to 78 at McAllen, Texas.
