   The stock market edged upward today, aided what
analysts described as yearend ``bargain hunting.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.92 to 2,693.05 by
11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 701 up, 483 down and
531 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 44.38 million shares at
midmorning.
   Traders appeared to be shopping warily among recently depressed
stocks, hoping that the market will gather strength after the
pressure of tax selling is lifted with the arrival of the new year.
   At the same time, however, the rally bid was faced with an
obstacle in the form of the Commerce Department's report that new
factory orders for durable goods rose 5.1 percent last month.
   That increase contrasted sharply with advance estimates of
little or no change in orders for relatively high-priced,
long-lasting goods.
   The suggestion it carried of unexpectedly brisk economic
activity helped push interest rates higher in the credit markets.
   Caterpillar dropped 1{ to 56[ on top of a 1~-point loss
Thursday, when the company reduced its earnings projection for the
fourth quarter.
   Campbell Soup fell 3| to 53[. Recent takeover speculation about
the stock faded a bit after a statement late Wednesday by three
members of the company's controlling Dorrance family that they were
committed to keeping it independent.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.40 to 190.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .13 at 369.68.
