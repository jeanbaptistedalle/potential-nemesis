<TEXT>
   The following is the text of a statement
issued Saturday at the Vatican regarding former Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega. The statement was translated from Italian by The
Associated Press.
   Regarding the case of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who took
refuge in recent days in the apostolic nunciature of Panama, the
Secretariat of State declares:
   In the course of the consultations that have taken place in
recent days between the Holy See and U.S. authorities over the case
of Gen. Noriega, the two parties have agreed to continue to remain
in close contact to examine together, in a spirit of serene
collaboration, the various aspects of the complex case and the
possibility of arriving at a just solution which will be mutually
satisfactory, keeping in mind that, in receiving Mr. Noriega in the
apostolic nunciature, the apostolic nuncio did not intend to block
the course of justice regarding a person accused of serious crimes,
but to promote the end of a conflict that in previous days had
caused so much destruction and so many victims, and could have gone
on indefinitely in the form of guerrilla warfare.''
