   Pope John Paul II will tour 11 cities and
towns in seven days during a visit to Mexico next May, a Roman
Catholic Church representative said Friday. This will be the pope's
second visit to Mexico in 11 years.
   Monsignor Girolamo Prigione, the Vatican representative in
Mexico, said in a news release John Paul will visit May 6-13. The
Vatican does not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Mexico,
which considers itself a secular state.
   According to Prigione, the pontiff will make stops in Mexico
City, a poor nearby town called Chalco, the gulf port of Veracruz,
the northwestern city of Aguascaliente, the town of San Juan de los
Lagos in western Jalisco state, the northern cities of Durango,
Chihuahua and Monterrey, and the southeastern cities of Tuxtla
Gutierrez and Villahermosa.
