   Boeing Co. plans layoffs in the first half of
1990, particularly among production workers at Everett, Chairman
Frank Shrontz said Thursday.
   Shrontz's comment in a Seattle Times interview confirmed recent
speculation that jobs would be cut at the giant aerospace company.
   Shrontz said it was too early to specify how many workers would
be laid off but ``it is pretty clear we will bring down employment
in the Puget Sound area in the first half of next year.'' He
characterized the layoffs as ``modest.''
   In the early 1970s as many as 60,000 workers lost their jobs in
a two-year period.
   Boeing employs about 107,000 people in Washington state and
165,000 worldwide.
   Shrontz said the company had anticipated a reduction in
production workers who were needed for startup work on the 747-400
jetliner, but originally had not thought layoffs would be necessary.
   But increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines
is lessening the need for all the workers, Shrontz said, even
though the company is experiencing a record surge in orders _ 888
jets worth $46.7 billion this year. There is also an $85 billion
backlog of more than 1,700 planes.
   Shrontz said he had hoped excess workers could be transferred to
work on the B-2 Stealth bomber, but B2 work was slowed as part of
defense-budget cutbacks, leaving the extra commercial jet workers
nowhere to go.
   Boeing, a subcontractor to the Northrop Corp. on the new bomber,
has had nearly 10,000 people working on the B2.
   Shrontz said some engineers in Wichita, Kan., also may lose
their jobs.
   A 48-day Machinists union' strike that ended last month
``clearly hurt our profitability,'' Shrontz said, but he declined
to be specific.
   Boeing had been expected to deliver 94 jets during the fourth
quarter but now may deliver less than half that number.
   ``We hope to get (the factories) back up to speed in the first
quarter,'' he said.
   On another topic, he said Boeing ``clearly has been hurt in
image'' by a flurry of federal investigations and charges filed
this year.
   ``The defense business is very difficult,'' he said. ``There is
still a significant resentment against defense contractors by the
public and I foresee this climate will continue.''
   Richard Fowler, a former Boeing Aerospace employee, was recently
convicted of 39 counts of document trafficking and fraud in federal
court in Alexandria, Va. Boeing agreed to pay a $5.2 million fine
and pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally receiving secret
government documents in the case.
   ``What's so frustrating about this is that it occurred in the
early 1980s,'' said Shrontz. ``I think we've gained substantially
in ethics since then.''
   He said the company has found no further evidence of fraud or
misconduct in federal investigations of project billings. The
government continues to investigate the overbilling allegations.
   On other topics, Shrontz said that while Boeing is reorganizing
its defense business divisions, the company will stay in defense
work.
   ``We'll find our niche,'' he said.
   It likely will be a few months before Boeing knows if its
proposed 777 wide-body twinjet is viable, he said. Possible
participation in the 777 by Japanese manufacturers is up in the
air, as are firm orders from airlines.
