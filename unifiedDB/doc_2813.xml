   An Amtrak train crashed into a car
Saturday, killing the driver, who apparently drove around lowered
barriers and stopped on the tracks, an Amtrak spokesman said.
   ``The preliminary investigation indicates that this incident was
a suicide,'' said R. Clifford Black.
   The train, made up of a locomotive and four passenger cars, was
heading south when it struck the car at the East Barber St.
crossing, Black said.
   The engineer was unable to stop the train until it was about a
half-mile from the crossing, Black said.
   The train was the Baystater, which goes from Boston to
Washington, D.C., by way of Springfield, Mass., and Hartford.
   Black said the 100 passengers on the train remained on board,
and the train resumed its trip.
