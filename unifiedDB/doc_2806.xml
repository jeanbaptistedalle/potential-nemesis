<UNK>White House Errs on Hometown of ``Point of Light'' Teenager.</UNK>

   The White House said Saturday it made a
mistake on the hometown of a 17-year-old Delaware girl whom it
honored as a daily ``Point of Light.''
   Stephanie Ann Fox, 17, lives in Milton, Del., not Milford, Del.,
as the White House had announced on Thursday, said White House
spokesman Stephen Hart.
   Miss Fox was born in Milford, but lives in Milton, Hart said.
   She was praised for making ``as a regular part of her life''
involvement in a student anti-drug organization and in helping to
raise funds to combat epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, cancer and
spouse abuse.
   The White House names an individual or organization each day for
best exemplifying Bush's ``thousand points of light'' theme, in
which each point represents a volunteer community service effort.
