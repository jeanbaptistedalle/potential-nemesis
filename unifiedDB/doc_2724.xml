   The United States praised the Vatican
on Friday for its efforts to ease Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out
of the Vatican mission where he has taken refuge, and U.S. forces
detained two more top aides to the increasingly isolated former
dictator.
   The Vatican said, however, it would take steps _ which it did
not specify _ if U.S. harassment of the papal embassy and Noriega
does not stop.
   ``The nuncio is doing his best to convince General Noriega to
abandon the nunciature on his own, by himself,'' said Joaquin
Navarro, Vatican spokesman in Rome. ``At the same time he cannot
force Noriega to leave nor can he consign him to U.S forces.''
   For Noriega, leaving the embassy would be tantamount to
surrendering to U.S. troops posted 10 feet from the gate. The
troops are inspecting all cars, including that of papal nuncio
Sebastian Laboa.
   President Guillermo Endara said he expects Noriega ``to be
invited out of the nuniciature soon. That's what we want.'' He said
this would be ``within days.''
   U.S. forces detained Noriega's personal doctor and chief
economic adviser, bringing to six the number of top aides that have
been arrested or have surrendered by leaving the embassy the last
48 hours. Those reported in custody include Michael Harari, an
Israeli security adviser and close aide to Noriega.
   Late in the afternoon U.S. troops turned down the volume on
music that has been blaring through the neighborhood around the
embassy. The music was still loud, but not as deafening at 150
yards as before.
   U.S. troops later surrounded the residence of Nicaraguan
Ambassador Antenor Ferrey and refused to let reporters within 100
yards. Shots were fired nearby, but their origin could not be
determined.
   The ambassador at an evening news conference said all personnel
inside were ordered to evacuate and the premises were searched for
weapons.
   ``This violates the principal foundations of the
extraterritoriality of diplomatic missions,'' Ferrey said. ``The
North Americans are going to pay for it.''
   In Nicaragua later Friday, President Daniel Ortega said 20
American diplomats will be expelled in retaliation for the
incident, which he called ``unheard of.''
   Ortega also said the U.S. Embassy will be forced to ``compact
its 220 of its personnel of 320, leaving only 100 in service.'' It
was not immediately known how many are American.
   Ferrey said American troops that searched the building for about
two hours seized five rifles inside the residence. Ferrey said the
guns were for self-defense.
   A U.S. Army colonel in charge of the operation later apologized
and returned the rifles, Ferrey said.
   The troops left the area about 9:30 p.m. EST after staying about
four hours. Witnesses said more than 60 troops had arrived at the
residence in trucks and armored cars.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman William Barr said he knew nothing of the
incident. Air Force Col. Ronald Sconyers at Southern Command also
said he had no information.
   In a separate incident, a Cuban diplomat, press attache Jorge
Sosa Chacon, was briefly detained by American soldiers and then
released. It was the second such detention in as many days at the
Cuban Embassy.
   The first members of the country's new security forces were
patrolling streets Friday. A U.S. military source said most had
been members of Noriega's dismantled Defense Forces, although
nearly all Noriega's top officers are believed jailed in military
installations run by the United States.
   Also Friday, the remains of an American teacher were discovered
in Panama and his daughter blamed Panamanians for his death.
   The American _ the third U.S. civilian to die since the conflict
began _ was identified by his daughter as Raymond Dragseth, a
teacher at the Panama Canal College, a Defense Department facility.
   Dragseth was reported to be the uncle of Richard Paul, a Defense
Department dependent who was killed a week ago. An American who was
working in Panama as a school teacher, Candy Helin, was killed
shortly after the invasion began.
   Carolyn Dragseth, appearing at a news conference from Panama
broadcast by CNN television, blamed Panamanians for the abduction
of her father, saying, ``They just took my father _ I don't know
why.''
   ``They came here looking for Americans,'' she said. CNN said
Raymond Dragseth was abducted from the family's apartment several
hours after the American invasion began Dec. 20.
   At the United Nations, the General Assembly adopt a resolution
by a 75-20 Friday that ``strongly deplores'' the U.S. invasion.
Sponsored by Nicaragua and Cuba, the resolution demands the
withdrawal of 26,000 U.S. troops and calls the military action a
flagrant violation of international law.
   The new Panamanian government under Endara voted against the
resolution.
   In other developments, estimates of the damage in the looting
spree that tore through Panama City after the attack climbed to $2
billion, according to the Chamber of Commerce.
   Panamanians continued working to recover from the chaos and
destruction that followed the U.S. invasion. Newspapers ran ads
asking people who looted merchandise to bring back the goods and
offered rewards with no questions asked.
   The toppled strongman was holed up inside the two-story embassy,
keeping largely to his room and speaking to few people, according
to a parish priest familiar with conditions inside the nunciature.
   Speaking at a news conference, Endara said Noriega is staying
``in the same room, sleeping in the same bed, watching the same
television I watched when I took refuge there.'' Endara also took
refuge at the embassy after Noriega's henchman botched the May 7
presidential election won by Endara.
   Endara also announced $50 million had been flown in by plane
from the United States Friday as part of the Panamanian assets
released after being frozen by the Bush administration last year to
pressure Noriega economically.
   During the night the troops flooded the embassy with light and
on Friday added a loudspeaker to their outdoor stereo system.
   The music, which includes rap and rock, prevents journalists in
a nearby hotel from eavesdropping but the noise also seems intended
to get on Noriega's nerves and includes numerous taunting songs.
   Navarro said disturbances created by U.S. troops were not
helping talks and hinted measures would be taken.
   ``If this is going to continue, further steps will be taken'' by
the Vatican, Navarro said without elaborating.
   In Corpus Christi, Texas, where President Bush is vacationing,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater played down the deadlock.
   ``It's a very difficult situation, very tense circumstances.
They are managing a difficult situation,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   For the first time since the invasion, there was no fighting
reported.
   When Noriega showed up at the papal nunciature Christmas Eve, he
created a diplomatic problem for all sides.
   The United States and Panama say Noriega is a criminal, wanted
on drug trafficking charges in Florida, not a political refugee,
and therefore the nuncio has no obligation to keep him.
