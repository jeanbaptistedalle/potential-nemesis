   An explosion destroyed a closed resort
hotel, and police said Sunday that organized crime figures were
probably responsible. Five months ago, the hotel manager's son was
gunned down in the street.
   No injuries were reported in the blast Saturday night at the U
Riposo hotel in Sagone on Corsica's western coast, police
investigators said.
   Whoever set the blast used bottles of gas and 220 pounds of
unidentified explosives that smashed the foundation of the 22-room,
three-story hotel, hurled rubble across the street and lit up the
night sky, police said.
   The hotel was for sale and had been closed since the end of the
summer.
   On Aug. 7, Jean Renouard, the son of the hotel manager, was shot
to death while sitting in his car.
   The previous manager, Jean Dupuis, was killed in a similar
fashion in 1985. Dupuis had been involved with a local citizens'
law enforcement organization.
   Police did not explain why organized crime figures would have
targeted the hotel or its staff.
   Organized crime in Corsica, a poor region whose main industries
are fishing and tourism, has traditionally been based on
kidnapping, extortion and murder. In recent years gangsters have
increasingly turned their attention to drugs.
