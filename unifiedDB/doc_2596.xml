   A Canada goose stuck in an icy pond was
free by the time rescuers began crawling across the pond's frozen
surface, but the rescuers grabbed the goose anyway and took it to a
veterinarian for treatment.
   The goose, which had spent the past few days with its feet
frozen into four-inch ice at Crowders Mountain State Park, freed
itself Thursday when the ice began to thaw, said Wayne Smith,
director of the Gaston County Animal Control Department.
   Nonetheless, an animal control officer, wrapped in a rubber life
raft and tied to a rope on shore, slid out and nabbed the goose,
which appeared to have a broken leg. It was taken to Forestbrook
Animal Hospital for examination.
   The leg wasn't broken, but the bird was suffering from
borderline frostbite, an unusual ailment for an animal used to
living in cold climates, said veterinarian Dr. Mark Epstein.
   Vets treated the bird with anti-inflammatory medicine. It was
eating well and appeared healthy, Epstein said, but it wasn't clear
whether the bird would be set free.
