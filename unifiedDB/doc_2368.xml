   The pilot of an F-15 Eagle jet fighter
was missing Thursday after his plane crashed into the Gulf of
Mexico during a mock dogfight, an Air Force spokesman said.
   The single-seat jet from Eglin Air Force Base crashed about 40
miles southeast of this Florida Panhandle community at 11:42 a.m.,
said Capt. Gary Perugini, public affairs officer for the 33rd
Tactical Fighter Wing.
   The plane was one of two F-15s from the 33rd that were engaged
in a combat training mission against two F-16 Falcon jets from
Moody Air Force Base in Georgia, Perugini said.
   The other three planes returned to their home bases, he said.
   The Coast Guard assumed responsibility for search and rescue
Thursday afternoon, but there were no reports of either the pilot
or any wreckage, military spokesmen said.
   An interim accident investigation board was convened after the
crash Thursday.
   The F-15, manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, is the Air Force's
most sophisticated fighter, powered by twin jet engines and capable
of flying at 2.5 times the speed of sound.
