   Here is a brief summary of events Saturday in Romania:
   _Revolutionary leaders announce the capture of President Nicolae
Ceausescu, his wife, Elena, who is the deputy premier, and the
third ranking leader, Emil Bobu. The new provisional government
said they will be put on trial.
   _The revolutionaries say they control the country, but sporadic
fighting continues. Skirmishes continue in the capital between army
units siding with pro-reform protesters and security forces loyal
to the deposed Ceausescu. Much of the fighting appears to be
guerrilla warfare by loyalist forces desperate to avoid capture.
   _Anti-Ceausescu forces catch and kill loyalists on the spot. An
AP reporter witnesses summary executions near the Bucharest post
office.
   _The Soviet Union, the International Red Cross, Britain, France,
Sweden and numerous other nations announce plans to ship crucial
medical and food supplies to the embattled nation. But they report
difficulty in bypassing blockades at the border.
   _Romanian embassies worldwide shift their allegiances to the new
government. Diplomatic missions in Washington, Iran, the
Netherlands, Libya, the Soviet Union, Jordan, Sweden, Turkey,
Greece, Poland, Sudan and many others announce support for the new
leadership.
   _Citizens waving flags and cheering the revolution venture out
into the streets, despite the fighting. Taxis are commandeered to
carry bodies in Bucharest, and residents carry knives and sharp
sticks to defend against attacks by pro-Ceausescu forces in the
city of Timisoara.
