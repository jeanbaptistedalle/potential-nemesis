   Maoist guerrillas killed 11 people,
including a judge and a teacher, in three separate attacks in the
Peruvian highlands, police said Sunday.
   The bodies of a married couple and another man, all peasant
farmers, were found Sunday in the ashes of a house destroyed by
fire in the town of Chaquicocha, 30 miles west of Huancayo. The
city in the Andean highlands 140 miles east of Lima is a hub of
guerrilla activity.
   Police said a message painted on a wall of the burned house
said: ``Death to informers.'' The victims' bodies showed bullet
wounds in the head and signs of torture.
   Police also said Shining Path guerrillas shot to death seven
people in two neighboring villages 27 miles south of Huancayo on
Friday, including a judge and a teacher from the village of Moya.
The other five victims were from San Mateo.
   Another peasant farmer was shot to death late Saturday in his
home in Sapallanga, a village six miles southeast of Huancayo,
according to police.
   The Mao-inspired Shining Path launched its armed insurgency
against Peru's elected governments in 1980. The government says
more than 17,000 people have died in the violence.
