   Stock prices declimed erratically today amid
persistent worries about the future course of the economy.
   Analysts said the latest economic reports from the government
hadn't done much to pull the market out of its recent slide,
induced to a great extent by worries about the real estate market
and mortgage debt.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.4 percent in November, or at an annual rate of 4.9 percent. That
appeared to put a new obstacle before any fresh moves by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Separate government figures showed a 4.7 percent decline in
housing starts last month.
   Brokers said that left stocks in the grip of recession fears and
of talk that a slump in business conditions might be exacerbated by
a weak market for homes and other real-estate properties.
