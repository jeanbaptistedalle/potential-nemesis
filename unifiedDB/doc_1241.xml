<HEAD>U.S. Pulls Some Embassy Workers, Issues Travel Advisory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The State Department said Friday it is
evacuating dependents and some workers at the U.S. Embassy in
Romania and urged other Americans to leave the country because of
the ``deteriorating situation'' there.
   The department issued a travel advisory warning Americans to
avoid traveling to Romania, where numerous deaths have been
reported in a violent crackdown against anti-government
demonstrations.
   ``There has been no immediate threat directed at U.S.
citizens,'' the travel advisory said, according to Nancy Beck, a
State Department press officer. ``However, there has been random
violence against civilians and numerous reports of deaths and
injuries.''
   She said the dependents of American embassy workers and
``non-essential personnel'' will be flown out of Romania.
   ``The department, therefore, is strongly advising U.S. citizens
reident in Romania to depart and the embassy will provide
assistance to those who do,'' said the department statement.
