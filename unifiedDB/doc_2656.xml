   Nigeria's oil minister Rilwanu Lukman, who
also serves as OPEC's president, was raised to a new position
within the Nigerian government Friday in a major Cabinet reshuffle,
an official statement said.
   The new oil minister is Jubrin Aminu, a surgeon and former
education minister.
   OPEC was expected to take steps to install a new president. No
one answered telephones late Friday at the offices of the 13-member
cartel.
   The Vienna-based Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
has an alternate president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena.
It also has a secretary-general, Subroto, a former Indonesian oil
minister.
   Lukman became external affairs minister, succeeding Gen. Ike
Nwachukwu, who was moved back to the army as a general officer
commanding a division.
   Lukman's new position is considered to be a promotion, officials
said. Nigeria is forging strong diplomatic relations
internationally and Lukman was moved, observers say, because his
achievements as OPEC president and his diplomatic skills make him
well-suited to the post.
   Nigerian President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida took over the defense
portfolio while Defense Minister Gen. Domkat Bali, Nigeria's
longest serving general, was made the new interior minister.
   Three service chiefs in charge of the air force, navy and the
police also were removed and replacements named.
