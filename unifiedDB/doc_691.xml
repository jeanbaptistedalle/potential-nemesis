   Howard Rollins, co-star of the NBC series
``In the Heat of the Night,'' has taken time off because of illness.
   Carroll O'Connor, the show's executive producer and star, said
Tuesday Rollins entered a hospital several weeks ago after having
chest pains.
   Although the tests showed he had no coronary problems, the actor
decided to take some time off, he said.
   ``We are all expecting him to return to work in the near future
as soon as he is able to physically withstand our very strenuous
work schedule,'' O'Connor said.
   He called Rollins a ``vital part of the series,'' adding, ``I
miss him professionally and personally and want him back on the
set.''
   David Gerber, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM@UA
Television Production Group Inc., said the show, which is filmed on
location in the Covington area, may rely on guest appearances by
other actors while Rollins recuperates.
