   Grenades exploded at the Red Cross
headquarters in this capital and at an interior town, killing a
child and injuring a man, the fire department said Thursday.
   Five-year-old Elisa Chiquin Tax died from injuries suffered in
the explosion Wednesday in Santa Cruz del Quiche, 100 miles
northeast of Guatemala City. In that blast, an unidentified adult
also was injured, authorities said.
   Police said they had no clue who was responsible for either
explosion.
   Guatemala endured a rash of violence this year in which
explosions downed power lines and killed several people in business
districts and riding public transportation.
