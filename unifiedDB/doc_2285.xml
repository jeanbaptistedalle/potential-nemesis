   A Turk who worked as a guard and driver at
the Turkish Consulate in Naples fatally shot an Italian employee as
the two arrived for work today, then killed himself, a diplomat
said.
   The second consul at the mission, Selda Sagrioglu, said the Turk
apparently was distraught over family problems, including the
illness of a child.
   ``His family was arriving from Turkey'' and he was upset, Ms.
Sagrioglu said in a telephone interview.The shootings occurred
about 8:15 a.m. at the entrance to the consulate.
   The diplomat identified the Turk as Ahmet Gulauoglu and said he
had worked there for a couple of years.
   The Italian was identified as Vincenzo Di Scala, who handled
mail and other administrative chores at the consulate for about 15
years, Ms. Sagrioglu said.
   The two men reportedly had just taken some refreshments in a
coffee bar near the consulate.
