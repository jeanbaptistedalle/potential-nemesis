   Two former executives of the Enron Oil Corp.
were charged Wednesday with conspiring to defraud the company
through a series of phony oil trading transactions.
   The defendants were charged in federal court in White Plains,
N.Y., a New York suburb. They agreed to plead guilty at a later
date, said U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier.
   The former Enron executives are Louis Borget, who was the
president and chief executive officer, and Thomas Mastroeni, the
vice president and secretary-treasurer.
   The alleged phony transactions took place in 1985 and 1986
before both men left Enron Oil, a subsidiary of the Houston-based
Enron Corp., in 1987. Enron Oil Corp. is located in the Westchester
County community of Valhalla.
