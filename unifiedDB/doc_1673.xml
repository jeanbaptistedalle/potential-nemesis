   A powerful explosion rocked the storage
tank area of an Exxon refinery Sunday.
   No injuries were immediately reported, but the explosion touched
off a roaring fire and sent a plume of smoke 500 feet in the air,
said East Baton Rouge Civil Defense spokesman Ed Wright.
   The tank storage area is near a pipeline, Wright said.
   The blast shattered windows in the surrounding area and the
concussion could be felt as far away as 15 miles, residents said.
   A brief power outage was reported immediately after the
explosion, Wright said.
