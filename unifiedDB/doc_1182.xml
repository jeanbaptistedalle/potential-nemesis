   Analysts said evidence of a new move Wednesday toward easier
credit by the Federal Reserve encouraged buyers to nibble warily at
stocks that have lately suffered from worries about a possible
recession in 1990.

might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One explanation for the January effect is the lifting of yearend
selling pressures from investing institutions cleaning losers out
of their portfolios and individual investing realizing losses for
tax purposes.
