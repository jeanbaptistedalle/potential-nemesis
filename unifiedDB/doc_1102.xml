<HEAD>Roseanne Barr Suffering Exhaustion, Cancels Shows</HEAD>

   Comedian Roseanne Barr, who canceled her
wedding plans last week and said her fiance had entered an alcohol
and drug treatment clinic, Thursday pulled out of five theater
performances, citing exhaustion.
   Barr, the stand-up comic and television sitcom star who recently
made her first motion picture, ``has been forced to suspend all
current activities,'' said Susan Pfeifer, spokeswoman for the
Circle Star Center in San Carlos, south of San Francisco. ``Her
doctor has insisted that in order to preserve her health, she
reschedule all current engagements.''
   Barr's spokeswoman, Lisa Kasteler in Los Angeles, confirmed that
Barr was exhausted. ``She is at home and has not been
hospitalized,'' Kasteler said.
   Last week, Barr, 36, called off her January 20 wedding to Tom
Arnold, a former consultant to her show, ``Roseanne.''
   Barr protested Arnold's firing from the show and has stated that
she intends to leave television soon.
   Her first motion picture, ``She-Devil,'' with Meryl Streep, has
been a box-office disappointment so far.
   The shows at the Circle Star, a 3,700-seat theater-in-the-round,
were the only performances Barr had scheduled that were canceled,
Kasteler said.
   The theater had sold out the first of the shows on Dec. 28 at
$29.50 a ticket, and was close to selling out the others for prices
up to $40 a ticket for New Year's Eve, Pfeifer said.
   ``Because of the late date, we don't know if we'll be able to
schedule someone else those days,'' Pfeifer said.
   Barr rescheduled four of her performances for Feb. 22, 23 and
24, when she'll have two shows, but was unable to reschedule the
Dec. 31 performance, Pfeifer said.
