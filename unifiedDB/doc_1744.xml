   One jet returned to O'Hare International Airport
shortly after takeoff when the crew detected smoke in the cockpit,
and a second airplane landed safely after reporting hydraulic
problems, authorities said. There were no injuries.
   The pilot of United Airlines Flight 103, originating in Chicago
and bound for Los Angeles with 224 passengers and 10 crew members,
turned the plane around Sunday morning and brought it in with
emergency vehicles standing by, United spokesman Joe Hopkins said.
Passengers were put on another flight.
   American Airlines Flight 394, a Boeing 727 flying from Seattle
to Chicago with 130 passengers and seven crew members on board,
landed without incident after one of its three hydraulic systems
became inoperative, said American Airlines spokesman Lowell Duncan.
   ``There was no major problem,'' said Duncan, adding that the
plane had two backup hydraulic systems.
   Both planes were being examined Sunday.
