   The dollar was fluctuating in a narrow range in
Europe late this morning after having lost ground earlier in the
session.
   Gold prices fell.
   Foreign exchange traders stressed that the dollar's recent
weakness had only limited significance because of the lack of
trading volume.
   One Milan trader said activity was limited to a few customers
who need to close commercial positions before the end of the year.
   ``The market really doesn't exist,'' another Milan trader said,
adding that the dollar's decline ``takes place in a vacuum.''
   He said he expected the dollar to rebound next week when volume
returns to normal at the beginning of the new year.
   In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.05 yen to a closing 142.15 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 142.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6770 West German marks, down from 1.6895
   _1.5255 Swiss francs, down from 1.5355
   _5.7360 French francs, down from 5.7760
   _1.8957 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9080
   _1,258.00 Italian lire, down from 1,266.00
   _1.1573 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1587
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6270 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6255 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $402.10 a troy ounce,
down from $406.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $400.40.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $400.25, down from $406.00 bid late
Wednesday.
