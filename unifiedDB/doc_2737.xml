   Forty ships steamed through the
Panama Canal on its second day of 24-hour operations as officials
speeded processing to reduce a lengthy backlog caused by the U.S.
invasion.
   ``We have 128 ships waiting in line,'' Franklin Castrejon,
spokesman for the Panama Canal Administration, said Friday.
``Normally there are only 15 to 20 ships standing by.''
   Up to 36 ships a day normally cross the 45-mile-long waterway
that links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, Castrejon said.
   The canal was closed after U.S. forces invaded Panama on Dec. 20
to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. It resumed 24-hour operations
on Thursday.
   The new government of President Guillermo Endara is expected to
submit to U.S. authorities its candidate for the post of canal
administrator. A new administrator is to fill the post on Jan. 1.
   The United States appointed deputy administrator Fernando
Manfredo as interim administrator after the invasion.
   The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties call for the United States to
transfer control of the canal to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
