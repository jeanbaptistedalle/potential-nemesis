   Two leading art auctioneers are reporting more
than doubled yearly sales with the market for impressionist,
modern, and contemporary art racing to dizzying heights.
   Sotheby's fine art auctioneers on Tuesday reported worldwide
sales in 1989 of $2.9 billion, a 61 percent increase on 1988. And
Christie's reported worldwide sales in 1989 of $2.2 billion, a 69
percent increase.
   Michael L. Ainslie, president and chief executive officer of
Sotheby's Holdings Inc. said in a statement: ``The opportunities
for forming major collections have never been better as the flow of
significant works onto the market is stronger than we have ever
witnessed.
   ``More collectors are participating in our business, and
balanced competition from Asia, Europe and the United States has
become a regular feature of the international art auction market.''
   Sotheby's said auctions of Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art worldwide during its autumn sales season this year
alone accounted for $797 million of overall sales.
   Lord Carrington, chairman of Christie's International, said in a
statement: ``The strength of the market has been underpinned by the
growth in world wealth and the emergence of new buyers into the
arena. This has caused a change in the emphasis of the market
place, which has become more international.''
   He said New York has become the leading sales center.
