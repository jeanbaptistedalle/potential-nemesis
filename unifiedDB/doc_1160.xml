   A judge has refused to dismiss charges that the
president of Rite Aid Inc. tried to bribe an Ohio State Pharmacy
Board member.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian J. Greene on
Wednesday set a tentative trial date of Jan. 15 for Martin L.
Grass, who heads the nation's largest drug store chain.
   Grass, 35, and his attorneys appeared in court Friday to ask
Greene to drop the charges.
   Grass has denied government charges that he and Rite Aid, which
is based in Shiremanstown, Pa., were trying to put people on the
pharmacy board who were sympathetic to the company's interests.
   A secret Cuyahoga County grand jury unsealed on Aug. 1 accused
Grass and Rite Aid of offering a $33,000 bribe to pharmacy board
member Melvin Wilczynski. Prosecutors said the money was to be in
exchange for Wilczynski's stepping down from the board.
   Rite Aid has said it paid Wilczynski $33,249 for a legal buyout
of his consulting contract with Lane Drug Co., a division of
Peoples Drug Stores Inc. Rite Aid acquired Peoples Drug in April.
   The indictment charges Grass and Rite Aid with bribery and
possession of criminal tools. It alleges that Grass and the company
used an aircraft as the criminal tool last March and April.
   Both charges are felonies. The maximum penalty for the bribery
charge is a 10-year prison term and a $5,000 fine, and the charge
of possession of criminal tools is punishable by a maximum of five
years in prison and a $2,500 fine.
   Rite Aid has 29,000 employees and more than 2,200 discount drug
stores across the nation.
