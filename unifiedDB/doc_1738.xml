<HEAD>Mrs. Quayle Suggests Use of Morning After Pill for Rape Victims</HEAD>

   Marilyn Quayle said rape victims should be
allowed to abort a pregnancy, and in such cases she supported use
of a French morning after pill.
   The use of the pill, known as RU486, has been strongly fought in
the United States by anti-abortion groups.
   Mrs. Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, made her
comments in an interview Sunday on the use of a pill. Her
statements apparently contradict comments she made on the issue
last week.
   Mrs. Quayle said in a letter Thursday to John C. Willke,
president of the National Right to Life Committee, ``I do not
support any medical procedures or pills other than those that
actually prevent pregnancy.''
   Willke wrote her asking for a clarification of her position on
the issue.
   In the letter, it was not clear whether she was referring to
contraceptive pills or other pills, including RU486.
   ``I think that anyone who is raped should report it absolutely
immediately, and every step should be taken to insure that a
pregnancy has not occurred,'' Mrs. Quayle told the Daily News.
   ``Something like the French morning after pill, if proven
effective, would be very appropriate and would lessen the
psychological trauma of a rape victim,'' she said.
   RU486 is a synthetic chemical that causes an abortion by
inducing the uterus to expel the egg.
