   A Bengal tiger bit off a 19-year-old zookeeper's
arm as she was giving it water with a hose from outside its cage at
a northern Japan safari park, police said today.
   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
attack occurred Tuesday at the Tohoku Safari Park Zoo in Fukushima
state, 150 miles northeast of Tokyo.
   Kimie Nagasaku, told police from her hospital bed that she was
giving the animal water from outside the cage when it bit off her
right arm at the elbow, but she declined to discuss details, the
official said.
   The official said police believed she might have put her hand
into the cage as she guided the hose. The tiger could not have
reached through the 2-inch space between bars in the cage, he said.
   Akihiko Ando, a zoo official, said other keepers heard a scream
and rushed to the tiger's cage. Ms. Nagasaku had fed the tiger and
cleaned its cage daily since April 1, officials said.
   Ando said it was the first case of anyone being hurt by an
animal at the zoo since it opened 11 years ago.
   There are about 130 carnivorous animals in the zoo and about 1
million people visit it annually, he said.
