   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega told an American
lawyer that he expected the United States to invade his country,
hours before U.S. troops attacked, New York Newsday reported Friday.
   A member of the law firm Slotnick &amp; Baker met with Noriega to
discuss publishing rights to his memoirs, which the now-deposed
Panamanian leader has been writing for several months, partner
Barry Slotnick told the newspaper.
   Noriega said he had completed a ``substantial portion'' of the
manuscript, describing his rise to power through Panama's military
and detailing his work for U.S. intelligence, Newsday reported.
   ``He realized his time was very short in terms of his ability to
maintain himself in Panama,'' Slotnick said. ``He knew the Justice
Department wanted him on trial; he was aware the United States was
going to invade; he felt they wanted to kill or capture him.''
   He said Noriega appeared calm during the afternoon meeting
afternoon in Panama City. U.S. forces invaded at midnight Tuesday.
   Slotnick said no publishing agreement was reached. He said
Noriega would not allow any U.S. company to publish the book or buy
the film rights.
   The lawyer did not return a telephone call Friday.
