<HEAD>Cuba's Plans to Foul U.S. TV Transmission Pass First Tests</HEAD>

   Cuba has performed successful initial tests
on equipment to jam planned TV broadcasts to Cuba by the U.S.
government, the island's official news service said Tuesday.
   Granma, the official daily newspaper of the Communist
government, said the effectiveness of the interference devices
``has been partly proven.''
   The United States has been broadcasting radio transmissions to
Cuba via Radio Marti for five years. Congress backed funds for
television broadcasts earlier this year.
   In a joint statement published in Granma, Cuba's Communications
Ministry, armed forces and Radio and Television Institute said the
Cuban plan was prompted by the U.S. government's intention to put
into operation an anti-Cuban ``Television Marti'' next month,
Prensa Latina said.
   ``Faced with the Yankee threat to begin transmissions against
Cuba, larger-scale tests will be realized on national television
transmissions,'' the joint statement said.
   It said Cuban equipment would achieve ``a considerable level of
degradation of the enemy signal.''
   The U.S. transmissions constitute ``a flagrant violation of
national sovereignty and the norms and regulations for
telecommunications established by the United Nations and other
international organizations,'' the Cuban government statement said.
