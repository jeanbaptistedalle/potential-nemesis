   Security forces in Iran broke up three
heroin smuggling rings, seizing millions of dollars of the drug and
arresting 24 people, the official Islamic Republic News Agency said
Tuesday.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said members of the Islamic
Revolution Committees in the northwestern province of West
Azerbaijan confiscated 247 pounds of heroin worth an estimated $7.5
million the past few days.
   Security officers also seized a cache of weapons and ammunition,
IRNA said.
   The report said those arrested confessed to plans to bring three
tons of narcotics into the province, which borders Turkey and Iraq.
   Iran says it has arrested thousands of smugglers and pushers,
executing at least 1,000 since authorities launched a nationwide
anti-narcotics campaign last year.
   But opposition groups and human rights organizations say many
political prisoners are among those executed.
