   A photographer who led a fight to legalize
nudity on private property and spurred Kodak into returning
snapshots of naked subjects has been inducted into the Nudist Hall
of Fame.
   Ed Lange, 69, was ``utterly delighted'' with the American
Sunbathing Association's decision to place him on the 25-year-old
honors list, said Chris Moran, spokesman for the Elysium Fields
nude resort that Lange founded.
   ``It is a great honor from his perspective,'' Moran said
Tuesday. ``He has basically stuck his neck out for some 20 odd
years risking everything he had to prove a point _ that being
freedom of expression.''
   Lange was credited with persuading Eastman Kodak in the 1950s to
change its policy of refusing to return pictures of nude people
that were sent in for developing.
   Lange, whose photos have appeared in Time, Life, Vogue, and
Harper's Bazaar, opened Elysium Fields in Topanga, west of Los
Angeles, in 1967 and battled Los Angeles County to overturn its
anti-nudity law.
   In 1968, a judge ruled that the law prohibiting disrobing on
private property violated the right of self expression, free
association, due process and equal protection under the law.
