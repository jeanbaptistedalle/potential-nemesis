   Moslem bandits released a French
missionary and his niece on New Years Eve, a day after they were
kidnapped in the lawless southern Philippines, officials said
Monday.
   The Rev. Michel de Gigord and his 29-year-old niece, Benedict,
were freed unharmed Sunday night after negotiations between the
kidnappers and local officials, military and civilian authorities
said.
   They were handed over to Roman Catholic officials and were
expected to leave for France as soon as possible.
   The two were abducted by six armed men Saturday after leaving
Saint Mary's Convent in Marawi, 510 miles southeast of Manila.
   The incident occurred in a lawless region where hundreds of
people have been kidnapped in recent years. Official records show
no one has ever been convicted in any of the kidnappings despite
government promises to restore law and order.
