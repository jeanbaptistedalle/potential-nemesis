   Bowing to opposition led by the widow of the
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the Board of Education has reversed
itself and decided to keep ROTC out of the high school named for
the late civil rights leader.
   The board voted to cancel the three-year program of the Air
Force Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps that was to have begun
in February, Robert F. Wagner Jr., board president, said Thursday.
   The board had approved the program in June, two months after the
faculty voted 102-59 against it.
   Wagner said a letter from Mrs. King to the board on Nov. 15 was
decisive. It said: ``My late husband, Dr. King, believed in the
principles of non-violence and worked tirelessly to pass this
message on to the youth of America. While I understand the need for
ROTC programs in other high schools, I believe that a military
program has no place in a school named in his honor.''
   Three city high schools have ROTC programs, which afford
students who complete the course a chance for scholarships and
possible admission to service academies.
   Air Force officials have said that if the program scheduled for
King High were not instituted there, it would be moved to another
city, possibly Rochester.
