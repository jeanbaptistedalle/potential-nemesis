   Two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters
collided in flight near a densely populated area today, sending one
of the jets crashing into a market and killing one pilot, officials
said.
   There were no reports of injuries on the ground.
   Spokesman Doug Moore said from the U.S. Air Force headquarters
in Ramstein that one pilot was taken to a U.S. Army hospital and
that his condition was not known.
   Moore said the fate of the pilot of the second aircraft had not
been determined. However, local police said in a statement released
to the news media that the second pilot was killed.
   No names were released. The pilots were the only crewmembers in
the planes at the time of the crash.
   Moore said the planes collided during a training flight at about
4:20 p.m. near Ludwigshafen, about 60 miles southwest of Frankfurt.
   ``Initial reports are that there were no injuries or casualties
on the ground,'' the spokesman told The Associated Press.
   Police in Ludwigshafen said one of the planes crashed into a
wholesale vegetable market. Hesse state radio said that a dozen
people were in the market at the time.
   The police statement said the second plane crashed several miles
away in the town of Bobenheim-Roxheim.
   No other details were immediately available.
