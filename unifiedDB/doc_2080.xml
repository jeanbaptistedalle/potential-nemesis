   Actress Betty Garde, who appeared in hundreds
of radio plays and portrayed Aunt Eller in the original Broadway
production of ``Oklahoma,'' is dead at 84.
   Miss Garde died Monday at a Sherman Oaks hospital, said Elliott
Reid, a longtime friend.
   Born Katherine Elizabeth Garde in Philadelphia, the actress
began her stage career in the early 1920s. She played character
roles in Broadway productions such as ``The Social Register'' and
``The Primrose Path.''
   In the 1930s she moved into radio, appearing in three dozen
shows over the years, including ``The Eddie Cantor Show,'' ``Perry
Mason'' and ``The Fat Man.''
   She probably was best known as the wife of ``Lorenzo Jones'' and
as ``Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch.''
   She worked on several Orson Welles radio specials and appeared
regularly in the dramatic anthology ``Theater Guild on the Air.''
   She had a few motion picture and television roles, notably as
Wanda Skutnik in the James Stewart film ``Call Northside 777.''
   Reid said she had no known immediate survivors.
