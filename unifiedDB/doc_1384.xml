   Israel television broadcast unique footage
Friday of a former French hostage in Lebanon interviewing Moslem
Shiite prisoners of an Israeli-backed militia.
   The taping by Roger Auque, who was released in November 1987
after 10 months of captivity in Beirut, marks the first time
outsiders have been allowed in the South Lebanon Army's el-Khiam
prison.
   The Israeli-backed militia had never allowed Red Cross or U.N.
officials to enter the prison, which is just north of the Lebanese
town of Marjayoun.
   Prisoners interviewed by Auque said they were treated
adequately, but they expressed hope that Lebanese Shiite militias
would agree to a prisoner exchange with Israel.
   The television said the Defense Ministry agreed to allow Auque
to tape in the stark prison to show conditions are acceptable and
to increase pressure on the Lebanon's Shiite Amal and Hezbollah
militias to agree to a prisoner exchange with Israel.
   Israel television said the broadcast was made for a French
television network but gave no other details.
   The television said an estimated 300 prisoners, mainly Shiites,
are held in el-Khiam. The prisoners include both guerrillas and
criminal suspects.
   Israel has offered to swap the prisoners and Sheik Abdul-Karim
Obeid, a pro-Iranian Shiite cleric abducted by Israel in August,
for three Israeli servicemen and all other foreign hostages held in
Lebanon.
