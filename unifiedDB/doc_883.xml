   Stocks in London were sharply higher at midday
Wednesday, boosted by Wall Street's recovery on Tuesday.
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 20.8 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,362.9
points.
   The market received additional impetus from the release of
British money supply data for November, which showed that the
government efforts to keep a tight grip on Britain's money supply
may be succeeding.
   The market was also led forward earlier in the day by the end
December Financial Times-Stock Exchange futures contract, which at
one point showed a 10-point premium to the underlying market.
   Volume came to a healthy 353.4 million shares by midday compared
with 357.6 million shares at the same time Tuesday.
