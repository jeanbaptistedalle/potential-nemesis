   A moderate earthquake struck the
Hollister area Monday, but no damage or injuries were reported.
   The quake, at 9:07 a.m., measured 4.1 on the Richter scale and
was centered in an area 13 miles south-southeast of Hollister, the
U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in the strength of the shaking. Thus, a reading of 7.5 reflects an
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5.
   On Oct. 17, a major quake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale
struck Northern California, killing 67 people, injuring about 3,000
and causing $7 billion in damage.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.
