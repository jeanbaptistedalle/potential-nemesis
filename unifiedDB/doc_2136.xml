<HEAD>Experts: Number of Bugs May Be Down Because of the Cold</HEAD>

   The cold snap may have had at least one
beneficial effect by putting the chill on next summer's bug
population.
   The record cold last week and over the weekend may have killed
off large quantities of fleas, ticks, gnats, mosquitoes and flies,
said Frank Funderburk, a Bibb County extension agent.
   ``It's hard to say what nature is going to do, but the insects
that bother man should be less in number early in the summer,'' he
said.
   The bug population could be back by late summer, Funderburk
said. And household pests, such as cockroaches, probably won't be
affected by the cold, he said.
   The cold also may have slowed the spread of a virus that damages
peanuts, tomatoes and peppers, Sumter County Extension Agent Tim
Lawson said. The virus is carried by aphids and thrips, insects
susceptible to low temperatures, he said.
   Georgia's peaches may have gotten a boost from the cold. Peach
grower Robert Dickey of Musella said the cold was a good down
payment on the 850 hours of ``chilling'' temperatures the trees
need.
   ``It couldn't be anything but beneficial to us peach growers,''
he said. ``Last winter we didn't get the adequate chilling required
and that was one reason our peach crop came up real short.''
