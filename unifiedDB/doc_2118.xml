   An East German company is taking over sale of
pieces of the crumbling Berlin Wall, with the proceeds to be
donated to humanitarian causes in East Germany, the official news
agency ADN said Wednesday.
   ``Limex-Bau Export-Import Co. is taking over the sale of
available original parts of the Berlin Wall,'' ADN said.
   ``Profits will be used solely for humanitarian purposes, such as
health facilities,'' ADN said, quoting the state-owned company's
manager, Peter Pfannschmidt.
   East German border troops will help secure parts of the wall
made available for sale, ADN said.
   Up to now, sale of parts of the wall had been left up to
companies outside East Germany, the report said. It did not
identify the firms.
   Since the Berlin Wall was opened Nov. 9, hundreds of souvenir
hunters have flocked to the western side of the barrier daily to
chisel away pieces.
   Ambitious hawkers have been selling small chunks of the wall to
tourists in West Berlin for prices ranging from $2.95 to $29.
   In most cases, authorities have not interfered with the wall
chiselers, but last week West Berlin police detained two Americans
and a West Berlin man who had loaded five 3-foot-by-8-foot sections
of the wall onto a truck. The men, who were not identified, were
released.
