   The Bush administration today accused the
government of Romania of ``brutal repression'' in opening fire on
anti-government protesters in the capital of Bucharest and in the
city of Timisoara.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater also dismissed any
suggestions of a parallel between the bloody crackdown and on the
U.S. military invasion of Panama on Wednesday.
   Romania, a hardline Soviet ally, condemned the United States for
``brutal aggression'' in Panama. But Fitzwater insisted that the
United States was reinforcing the will of the Panamanian people
with its military action.
   At his daily news briefing, Fitzwater was asked why Panama was
different.
   ``They had an election there that registered the people's
wishes'' to be rid of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ``by a
three-to-one margin,'' he replied.
   Of Romania, Fitzwater said: ``We understand the demonstrations
there are continuing. We are monitoring the situation.''
   He called on the Romanian government to ``cease its brutal
repression of these demostrators, open its borders and respect the
Helsinki commitments'' to human rights.
   ``A state of emergency exists in western Romania,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We do maintain there was a bloody massacre'' in the city of
Timisoara, where soldiers and police reportedly fired on hundreds
and perhaps thousands of people. ``We assume there are considerable
numers of people wounded and injured in these demonstrations,''
Fitzwater said.
