   The Health Care Financing Administration
released the names of 32 hospitals that had higher-than-expected
Medicare patient death rates with this explanatory statement:
   ``The actual mortality rate at the following hospitals exceeded
the upper bound of the range of predicted mortality for the `all
causes' category for 1986, 1987 and 1988.

hospitals was substandard nor that these hospitals are the poorest
performing acute care hospitals in the United States.''
