   Southwest Airlines will reduce many of its long
distance air fares through mid-March, the company announced.
   Southwest on Tuesday also placed a $99 ceiling on any one-way
fare purchased 21 days ahead of travel Mondays thru Thursdays and
Saturdays.
   In announcing the fares, Southwest marketing vice president
Donald G. Valentine pronounced the Dallas-based carrier the ``price
policeman'' of the airline industry.
   Under the reduction, customers must buy tickets by Jan. 20 and
travel between Jan. 6 and March 15. Customers using the rates may
not fly on Friday or Sunday, but there is not a Saturday night stay
requirement nor a minimum time before the customer can return.
   Fare reductions of up to 20 percent are also being put in place
on one-and seven-day advance purchases on flights generally of 600
miles or longer, Valentine said.
   Southwest is the nation's eighth largest carrier, serving 31
airports in 14 states.
