   A group headed by former baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth and California entrepreneur Thomas
Talbot has bought control of Hawaiian Airlines for $37 million.
   The deal, announced Friday, gives the Talbot Group 85 percent of
the common stock of HAL Inc., the Honolulu-based holding company
for Hawaiian Airlines and the West Maui Airport.
   Ueberroth and John H. Magoon Jr. were named co-chairmen of HAL.
Talbot was named president and chief operating officer.
   Ueberroth led a group that bid $464 million to buy Eastern
Airlines earlier this year. That deal collapsed because of acrimony
between Eastern's unions and its owner, Frank Lorenzo.
   The former baseball commissioner's first job after college was
operations manager and later vice president of a small airline in
Hawaii.
   Hawaiian Airlines serves the five Hawaiian Islands and 14
Pacific Rim cities, including Los Angeles, Seattle and Anchorage.
The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers in 1988.
   HAL lost $13 million in the first half of this year and has lost
a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.
