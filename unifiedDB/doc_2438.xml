   Stock prices crept ahead today, drifting
sluggishly through the next-to-last session of the year.
   Much of the activity appeared to be devoted to last-minute
maneuvering by investors for tax and yearend portfolio reporting
purposes.
   Analysts said money managers at many investing institutions had
pretty well closed their books on 1989, and thus were making few
waves in the marketplace.
   The government is due to report Friday on the index of leading
economic indicators for November.
   Advance estimates call for a flat to slightly higher showing by
the index, which would presumably do little to resolve the
questions in investors' minds about the economic outlook for the
first half of 1990.
