   Israelis lighted candles in their homes Friday
as Jews worldwide began celebrating the eight-day Festival of
Lights or Hanukkah, marking the victory of a Jewish rebellion over
Syrians 2,000 years ago.
   The festivities came during yet another day of violence in the
occupied territories, where Palestinians have been battling Israeli
occupiers. Israeli soldiers shot and killed three Palestinians,
Arab reports said.
   Throughout Israel, Hanukkah celebrations went on. Bakeries sold
special sugar-coated doughnuts that are a holiday tradition in
Israel.
   Israeli newspapers reported that a bakery in Tel Aviv baked what
may be the world's largest doughnut to mark the holiday. The Yediot
Ahronot newspaper said the jelly doughnut weighed 26 pounds.
   Hanukkah marks the victory of the Jews over the Greco-Syrian
kingdom in 165 B.C. The kingdom had tried to impose its culture on
the Jews and desecrated the holy temple in Jerusalem with statues
of Greek gods. Jews rose in revolt and drove out the Syrians.
   According to legend, when the Jews entered Jerusalem and tried
to rekindle the temple's eternal flame, they found enough oil for
only one day. But the oil miraculously lasted eight days.
   To commemorate the miracle, Jews light candles at sunset for
eight consecutive days. The candles are placed in an eight-branch
candelabra called a menorah.
   One candle is lighted the first day, and a new candle is used
each day until eight burn in the menorah.
