   Advertisements for the Infiniti luxury car
finally show the mysterious car itself.
   After months of new age ads featuring rocks and crashing waves,
Nissan Motor Corp.'s Infiniti Division and its advertising agency
switched gears Wednesday with two-page ads in major daily
newspapers nationwide.
   The ads in The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times and other
papers in 34 metropolitan areas featured 15 photos of the new
Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan.
   ``This is the evolution of the directional side of our
campaign,'' Chuck Kushell, executive vice president and general
manager of Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc.'s Marina del
Rey, Calif., office, said Thursday.
   The first phase of the advertising campaign featured serene
nature scenes and was intended to establish Infiniti's image,
Kushell said.
   In the new phase, he said, ``We have an opportunity to talk
about the products and actively support our dealers by telling
people that there's a dealer in their home town and where they can
find the car to drive it.''
   Kushell said the more general, image-setting ads will continue,
along with the more specific ads in areas with dealers.
