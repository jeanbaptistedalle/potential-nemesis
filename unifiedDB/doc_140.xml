   Inner-city church and community activists are
offering a $10,000 reward for the names of gang members believed to
have put a $5,000 bounty on the head of an anti-drug activist.
   Georgette Watson, a founder of the Drop-A-Dime hotline for
fielding tips on drug pushers, has been under 24-hour police
protection since last week. Gang members also allegedly offered
$1,000 to anyone wounding the mother of three.
   ``We are extremely concerned about the threats made against the
life of Georgette Watson,'' said the Rev. E.W. Jackson, who joined
about 15 church and community leaders Sunday in asking citizens to
contribute to the reward.
   ``It shows the gangs are not the only ones who can put out
bounties,'' Deputy Police Superintendent William Celester said.
``The community now is fighting back. What (the gangs) have done is
wake up a sleeping giant that is going to step on them.''
   Celester insisted on round-the-clock protection for Watson after
detectives verified informant reports that Watson's life was at
risk through Jan. 1, the deadline allegedly set by gang members who
want her dead.
