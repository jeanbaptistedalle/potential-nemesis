   Arnold Moss, an acclaimed classical actor who
also headed a Shakespearean company, portrayed movie villains and
played the voice of God in an opera, has died at age 80.
   He died Friday of lung cancer in his Manhattan home.
   Moss was praised by critics for his performances as Prospero in
``The Tempest'' in 1945 and as Malvolio in ``Twelfth Night'' in
1949. He formed his own repertory company, the Shakespeare Festival
Players and toured 50 American colleges.
   In movies, he often played the heavy and appeared in ``Viva
Zapata,'' ``Salome,'' ``Kim,'' ``Gambit,'' ``Casanova's Big Night''
and ``My Favorite Spy.''
   Moss narrated with the Boston, Detroit and Milwaukee orchestras
and provided the voice of God for the 1978 Chicago Lyric Opera
Company production of ``Paradise Lost,'' doubling as poet John
Milton.
   He began his stage career as actor-director at Eva LeGallienne's
Civic Repertory Theatre in New York.
   The ruthless Spanish colonel in Ernest Hemingway's ``The Fifth
Column'' was his first major Broadway role, and Moss went on to win
approval for his parts in ``The Front Page,'' ``Flight to the
West,'' and ``Journey to Jerusalem.''
   Moss performed on radio, too, in soap operas, as a spokesman for
the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and as a staff announcer for
CBS Radio in New York.
   The State Department sent him to Latin America, Africa and the
Far East as a specialist in theater.
   Surivors include his wife, Stella; his daughter, Andrea, of
Croton-on-Hudson; and his son, Jeffrey, of Manhattan.
