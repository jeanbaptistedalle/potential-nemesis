   Christmas trees can get a holiday stamp of
approval from the U.S. Postal Service with special ornaments on
sale this year.
   The silverplated ornaments, which sell for $12.95 each, are
being offered in about a third of the agency's divisions across the
country or may be ordered from the Postal Service Philatelic Sales
Division in Washington.
   The ornaments feature the annual Christmas stamps, one using the
religious version and the other the secular design. The stamps are
sealed in a clear resin and surrounded by a silver tracery styled
as clusters of holly leaves and berries.
   Postal service divisions where the ornaments were being offered
_ some only in limited quantities _ are:
   Baltimore and Prince Georges, Md.; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chicago and
South Suburban, Ill.; Columbia, S.C.; Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio;
Dallas and Houston, Texas; Denver; Des Moines; Detroit and Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Greensboro, N.C.; Hartford, Conn.; Indianapolis;
Kansas City; Los Angeles, Oakland, San Diego, Santa Ana and Van
Nuys, Calif.; Memphis and Nashville, Tenn.; Minneapolis; New
Brunswick, N.J.; Omaha, Neb.; Philadelphia; Richmond,
Charlottesville, Norfolk, Roanoke and Northern Virginia; St. Louis;
