   A meeting of all political parties
Friday nominated opposition leader Vaclav Havel for president and
Alexander Dubcek as Parliament chairman, the official news agency
CTK reported.
   Havel, a dissident playwright whose works were banned, emerged
as the opposition leader during a peaceful revolution that began in
mid-November and ended four decades of Communist rule.
   Dubcek was Communist Party chief in 1968 and led the ``Prague
Spring'' of reform that was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   CTK quoted a statement issued after Friday's meeting as saying:
``In agreement with the publicly expressed will of the Czechoslovak
public, we recognize as a respected representative ... for the
office of president Mr. Vaclav Havel and for the office of Federal
Assembly chairman Mr. Alexander Dubcek.
   ``We express our conviction that this manifested will is in
agreement with the spirit of Czechoslovak mutuality.''
   The talks also produced an agreement on restructuring
Parliament, which is to vote Dec. 29 on the two positions, the
agency said, but no details were available Friday.
   Although the majority of posts in the Cabinet are filled by
non-Communists, members of the party still dominate Parliament. The
Dec. 29 session is to be televised live.
