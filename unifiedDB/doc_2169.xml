   Three Romanian Olympic and world
shooting experts performed ``genuine acts of heroism '' by
annihilating a group of ``terrorists'' in Bucharest, the Romanian
news agency Agerpres said Wednesday.
   The agency, monitored in Vienna, said Ion Corneliu, Sorin Babii
and Gratian Calota ``fought at Ghencea Military Cemetery where they
annihilated a group of terrorists that furiously attacked an
important military target in the area.''
   The report did not say who the terrorists were, but they were
presumably loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   It did not give a specific date for that encounter nor for
others in which it said athletes paid a part.
   Agerpres said wrestlers Catalin Rosca and Ionel Baciu were
helping the militia at the Chitial checkpoint at the entrance to
the capital.
   Soccer players from Bucharest's Dinamo team fought alongside the
army in the palace square and Dinamo athletes now guarded the
emergency hospital, the agency said.
