   U.S. helicopters rescued an 11-member
Smithsonian Institution research team Friday morning from a jungle
where they had been taken by troops loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   The group, including a 4-year-old girl, was taken from an island
laboratory and put on a forced march into the jungle by 30 infantry
soldiers who then abandoned them without food or shoes.
   ``The worst part was walking down the main landing strip off to
the side and into the woods. Everybody thought they were going to
shoot us,'' said Steve Travers, a marine biologist with the
Smithsonian group.
   Nancy Knowlton, another scientist, said the group expected
trouble because of the U.S. invasion when it saw a Panamanian
patrol boat heading for the laboratory Wednesday morning.
   The research team talked the soldiers into letting them grab a
few belongings before they were hurriedly taken ashore. They
managed to sneak out three two-way radios with which they would
later guide U.S. armed forces to their location for rescue.
   Greg Summers, another member of the group, said they were taken
by boat to the airfield and then into the jungle. They walked from
11 a.m. Wednesday until 1 a.m. Thursday, he said.
   ``We really didn't know we were going to be walking halfway
across Panama,'' Knowlton said. At one point it appeared to the
hostages that their captors feared that they themselves were
isolated when word reached them that Americans were in control of
Panama City. They asked their captives to tell the American troops
that the researchers had been taken into protective custody. Then
the group was abandoned on Thursday.
   Using the radios they had hidden, the group contacted
Smithsonian officials in Panama City.
   Lt. Col. Joseph Umbarger, who coordinated the rescue, said at
first the U.S. military thought the situation might be a potential
trap, but then sent three helicopters on a dangerous nighttime
search over the jungle about 20 to 25 miles north of Panama City.
Although the pilots scoured the area for hours, the initial aerial
search team was forced to return without the hostages when their
fuel ran low.
   The group received help from a school teacher who, on Friday
morning, started taking them in a flatbed truck to the town of
Chepo. A second flight of helicopters which took off at dawn from
Fort Clayton spotted them in transit, when they jumped off the
truck and waved their clothing in a pre-arranged pattern to tip off
the soldiers.
   ``That was a fantastic moment, seeing the helicopters come,''
said Travers.
