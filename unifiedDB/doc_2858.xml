   Credit and bank cards belonging to a family
of four found slain last week were used to buy sneakers, underwear,
electronic equipment and diamonds the day after the killings,
police said Sunday.
   Descriptions and composite drawings of the buyers were
circulated over the weekend by police in the hope that someone
would recognize them.
   Six purchases totaling $1,334 were made Dec. 23, the day the
bodies of Warren Harris, 39, Dolores Harris, 41, and their two
children, ages 11 and 15, were found in their suburban Ithaca home,
police said. The four had been bound, shot in the back of the head
and their bodies set on fire the night before.
   Police believe the cards are being used by a man and a woman,
said Capt. Carl Shaver of the state police Bureau of Criminal
Investigation.
   The partly charred bodies were discovered when a neighbor heard
a smoke alarm. Police said there was no sign of a forced entry, and
neighbors speculated the friendly family may have opened their door
to people saying they had car trouble.
   The Harrises lived in Ellis Hollow, an affluent section of this
rural town about five miles from Ithaca in western New York state.
