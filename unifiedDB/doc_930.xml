   The inventor of an ultrasonic gun used to stun
racehorses was sentenced Thursday to 14 years in jail for his
involvement in a multimillion dollar cocaine ring.
   Southwark Crown Court Judge Gerald Butler also ordered assets of
auto dealer James Laming worth $38,320 be confiscated or Laming,
49, would face an additional 18 months in jail.
   A jury convicted Laming and two other men Nov. 14.
   Ring leader Rene Black, 35, was sentenced to 15 years for
masterminding the $24.8 million cocaine operation, which included
Europe's first cocaine factory.
   The judge ordered Black's $2.4 million in assets confiscated
with the threat of 10 more years in prison if he defaulted.
   Butler ordered Black deported to his native Peru after serving
his sentence in solitary confinement for his own protection.
   Police said Black was flown by helicopter to court hearings
because of fears former associates were trying to kill him.
   A third defendant, Patrick Fraser, 38, was sentenced to eight
years in jail for possessing 17 ounces of cocaine with intent to
supply.
   Black's father-in-law, Ronald Fisher, 52, was sentenced to 30
months after pleading guilty to helping Black launder
drug-trafficking money.
   Laming's defense was that he knew Black only as a backer of his
stun gun plan to undermine betting and bookmaking and was ignorant
of the cocaine ring.
   Testimony said Laming's stun gun disguised as binoculars could
fire a beam of sound over 50 feet, audible only to horses. The
effect on a racehorse would have been like a ``firework exploding
in its ear,'' the court was told.
   The prosecution called the stun gun a smoke screen to explain
away the drugs link.
