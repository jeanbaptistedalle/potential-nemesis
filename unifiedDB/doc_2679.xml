   Canon U.S.A. Inc. has agreed to pay $2.5
million to settle allegations that it overcharged the federal
government for copiers, the Department of Justice announced Friday.
   The department contended that Canon submitted incomplete and
inadequate price information to the General Services Administration
in bidding for contracts to rent and sell copies to federal
agencies.
   As a result, GSA was unable to negotiate prices equal to those
offered by Canon to its most favored commercial customers, the
department said.
   The alleged overcharges occurred during fiscal years 1984 and
1985.
   At Canon's headquarters in Lake Success, N.Y., company spokesman
Hajima Hirai declined comment on the department's announcement
except to say, ``We are satisfied with the way it is written.''
   The settlement was negotiated by the Commercial Litigation
Branch of the department's Civil Division.
