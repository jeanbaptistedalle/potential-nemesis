<HEAD>United to Match Midway in Cutting Winter Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   United Airlines, the nation's second largest
carrier, has announced it will match some winter fare cuts of as
much as 30 percent introduced by rival Midway Airlines Inc.
   United's action spread the fare-cutting that began last week
when Southwest Airlines Co. reduced prices on its longer routes, a
move other carriers followed on a limited basis.
   Midway, which operates its main hub out of Chicago's Midway
Airport, had announced one-way fares ranging from $19 to $99 across
its 50-city route system within the continental United States.
   ``The entire industry is seeing soft bookings the first
quarter,'' said Midway spokeswoman Laura Podlesny, in explaining
the fare cuts.
   Chicago-based United, whose main hub is at O'Hare International
Airport, said Tuesday it would match the fare cuts on routes where
it competes with Midway.
   ``We're going to be competitive, but not on all flights,'' said
United spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``In Dallas, Denver and Los Angeles,
for example, we'll offer the reduced fares on specific flights, but
not on all.''
   Midway reduced its Chicago-Los Angeles round-trip fare from $318
to $198, and its Chicago-Washington round-trip fare from $228 to
$158.
   The $39 round-trip fares _ $19 one way _ apply to routes
connnecting Chicago with Detroit and Kansas City. The fares
previously were $43.
   Midway officials waived minimum-stay requirements that usually
apply to discount tickets, but said the reduced-rate tickets must
be purchased by Jan. 20 and travel completed by March 31.
   United, the main holding of UAL Corp., did not specify whether
its fares would have minimum-stay requirements or expiration dates.
