   High winds aloft and low
temperatures on the ground combined to force the seventh
postponement of Martin Marietta's first commercial rocket launch _
but another try is set for tonight.
   Company officials reported winds about 30,000 feet above the
launch area were too stiff Thursday and the temperature on the
ground was too cool.
   The temperature must be at least 62 degrees for the launch of
the Titan 3 rocket. That will preserve the resiliency of synthetic
O-rings between joints in its two solid fuel rocket boosters.
   The rocket is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and British Ministry for Defense.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:06 p.m. EST today. It was
originally set for Dec. 7, but a combination of bad weather and
technical problems resulted in repeated delays.
