   A man who said small planes buzzing over
his desert homestead drowned out his portable radio has been
charged with using a 4-foot-square mirror to flash blinding
sunlight into pilots' eyes.
   Alcide Chaisson, 69, who lives in a trailer near Crystalaire
Airport, was cited Friday for obstructing a flight path, Los
Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia L. Ulfig said.
   ``It could be very hazardous,'' Ms. Ulfig said. ``They were
being blinded as they landed and took off.''
   Chaisson lives about 45 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
Crystalaire Airport is a small airfield serving private aircraft.
   The offense carries six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   ``The landing was the part that bothered us most. It was
definitely a real obvious distraction,'' said George Thomas, who
flies tow planes used to launch gliders.
