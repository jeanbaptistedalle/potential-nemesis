<HEAD>GE Wins $500 Million Engine Contract From South Korea</HEAD>

   General Electric Co. says it has won
a $500 million contract to build fighter plane engines for the
government of South Korea.
   The Koreans plan to buy about 250 F404-GE-402 engines to power
120 F@A-18 fighters, a plane built by McDonnell Douglas, GE
announced Thursday. The governments of Kuwait and Switzerland have
purchased smaller numbers of the engine.
   ``These foreign sales are important because they help offset
potential reductions in the U.S. defense budget,'' said Robert
Turnbull, GE's vice president of military engines.
   Turnbull estimated that the plant in Lynn, Mass., which will
handle the South Korean order, would be building 200 F404 engines a
year for the next 10 years. He said it was likely the U.S. Navy
would scale back its purchases in the early 1990s.
   GE was once sole supplier of the F404 engines. Then in 1984 Navy
Secretary John Lehman brought in Pratt &amp; Whitney, a United
Technologies Corp. unit, as a second source.
   That decision was recently reversed, however, and GE is once
again the only firm building the engine.
