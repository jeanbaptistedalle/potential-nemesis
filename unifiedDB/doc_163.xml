   Mayor-elect David Dinkins today named Houston
Police Chief Lee P. Brown as the city's next police commissioner.
   Brown, 52, will lead the nation's biggest police force, with
30,000 members, seven times more than Houston's. He takes office
Jan. 22, succeeding Richard Condon, who has held the post since
Benjamin Ward retired in October.
   At a news conference today in Houston, Brown said he considers
the New York City post a ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
   ``Obviously it's the largest police department, and the
opportunity to run the largest police department _ that's the
challenge,'' Brown, chief of Houston's 4,500-member force since
1982.
   Brown, who is black, has been credited with easing racial
tension in Houston. But the Houston force recently has been hit
with allegations of racism and corruption, as well as controversy
over shootings by officers.
   He is known to have opposed an all-civilian board to review
complaints against police in Houston, while Dinkins favors the idea
in New York.
   ``We didn't discuss it at great length,'' said Dinkins, who was
elected New York City's first black mayor. ``He's someone who's
concerned a lot about the behavior of police.''
   Brown, only the second out-of-towner named New York police
commissioner in 30 years, $110,000 a year in Houston and said he
would receive the same here.
   He was previously public safety commissioner in Atlanta, an
educator in criminal justice at Portland State University and
Howard University, and a sheriff in Oregon.
