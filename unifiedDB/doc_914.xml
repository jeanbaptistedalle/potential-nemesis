   The energy futures market ended mixed in
volatile trading Wednesday, erasing much of its earlier gains that
stemmed from news of a sudden U.S. military strike in Panama.
   Prices for crude and refined petroleum products had been up
sharply earlier in the trading day Wednesday on fears that the
closure of the Panama Canal, following the surprise attack by
American forces, might disrupt oil shipments.
   But analysts said the market had over-reacted.
   ``I think the reaction to the Panama closure was totally
irrational,'' Bob Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache,
said. ``Our crude oil supplies simply won't be disrupted.''
   Analysts said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to
the United States passes through the Panama Canal because the
waterway is too small to handle large tankers.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was
down 7 cents to settle at $21.21 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract
was up 11 cents on Tuesday.
   Among refined petroleum products, the January wholesale home
heating oil contract, supported in recent days from a cold spell
that hit parts of the nation, rose 0.75 cent to settle at 75.76
cents a gallon. On Tuesday, the contract gained 0.35 cent.
   January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.58 cent in the
previous session, ended 0.71 cent lower to 53.22 cents a gallon.
