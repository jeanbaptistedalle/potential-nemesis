   A small airplane that tried to hoist a banner
aloft from an airport and fly it over a professional football game
crashed Sunday, killing the pilot, a police official said.
   The Cessna 182 took off from Lunken Airport and had swooped back
over the airport low enough to hook a banner suspended between two
poles when the accident occurred around 1:30 p.m., said police
traffic officer Dan Katt.
   The plane lost power when it hooked the banner, Katt said. The
pilot quickly dropped the banner and tried to glide back toward the
runway for a crash landing, but clipped the top of a helicopter
which had just landed on a taxiway, he said.
   The pilot _ Robert Jeff Ott, 26, of Batavia _ was taken to
University Hospital in Cincinnati where he died, Katt said.
   Bobby Leach, a traffic reporter for radio station WKRC in
Cincinnati who was in the helicopter, was treated and released for
minor injuries at Mercy Hospital, Katt said.
   The helicopter pilot was not hurt, the officer said.
   The plane was attempting to carry the banner over Riverfront
Stadium for a game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Houston
Oilers. Katt said he did not know the size of the banner.
