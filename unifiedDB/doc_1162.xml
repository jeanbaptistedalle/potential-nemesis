<HEAD>Canal Commission Says It Plans To Reopen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal Commission said it
would reopen the canal today and allow 12 ships to travel the
waterway.
   Franklin Castrellon, a commission spokesman, said that passage
was restricted to 12 ships because of ``personnel limitations.''
   Passage through the 75-year-old canal _ which handles an average
of 33 ships daily _ was interrupted early Wednesday morning when
U.S. troops landed in Panama.
   The 51-mile canal usually operates 24 hours a day, but for now
will run only during daylight hours.
