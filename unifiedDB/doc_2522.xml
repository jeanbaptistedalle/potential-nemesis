   Northwest Airlines says strict security
precautions ensure that a Paris-Detroit flight Saturday will
operate safely despite a bomb threat that today caused at least 30
passengers to cancel reservations.
   In an unusual public response to a bomb threat, the airline
announced Thursday that any passengers who do not wish to take
Flight 51 may postpone their flight or switch to other carriers
without penalty.
   At Northwest's Paris office, sales manager Frederic Wuatelet
said at least 30 passengers had changed reservation by midday
today. Earlier reports said between 120 and 130 passengers were
booked on the DC-10.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman John Leyden indicated
there was little unusual about the threat itself, which he said
came in an anonymous phone call and was one of about 300 received
by U.S. airlines each year.
   Leyden said officials were ``working with Northwest and with the
French authorities to ensure there is extra security on the
flight.''
   Northwest's public response was a departure from the handling of
most threats against U.S. aviation, which generally are dealt with
stealthily and not mentioned to passengers.
   The FAA and airlines have come under pressure to be more
forthright in disclosing security risks after 270 people were
killed Dec. 21, 1988, when a bomb blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland. The plane, which had stopped in London, was en
route from Frankfurt to New York. A threat against Pan Am on the
Frankfurt-to-New York route got some distribution within the U.S.
government but was not made public. Government officials later
declared the threat a hoax even though its particulars fit the Pan
Am explosion.
   The FAA has a policy of not alerting the public to security
threats unless they are very specific and the flight involved is
not being canceled.
   The Northwest threat appeared to meet conditions that would
allow disclosure.
   ``This is an unusual threat in the fact that it's very specific,
directed at a specific flight on a particular day, and that is what
adds to the precautions that we're taking surrounding it,'' said
Northwest spokesman Douglas Miller in St. Paul, Minn.
   Miller said Northwest informed the FAA, FBI, CIA and foreign
agencies that would be involved, but he said the FBI had asked the
airline not to disclose any other details about the threat,
including where or when it was made.
   ABC News, quoting sources, reported Thursday night that a man
with a ``Middle Eastern accent'' made the threat to Northwest's
Detroit office, saying the bombing would be in retaliation for life
sentences handed down to two Palestinians convicted in Sweden of
charges connected with a string of bombings in Europe.
   One of the two, Abu Mohammed Talb, is a suspect in the Flight
103 bombing. He and co-defendant Marten Imandi were sentenced to
life for their part in the 1985 bombing of a Northwest office in
Copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 20, one of four
bombings in Denmark and the Netherlands for which they were
convicted.
   The threat against Northwest has brought tightened security for
all Northwest flights out of Paris, Miller said.
   ``We intend to fly the plane,'' he said. ``We feel that we have
all the precautions and security measures in place to operate the
plane safely. If we did not feel 100 percent positive about our
ability to fly the plane safely, we would not put it in the air.''
   Miller said the airline had not decided whether to attempt to
advise passengers individually prior to their arrival for the
flight, but a statement noting the bomb threat would be handed to
those who go to the airport for departure Saturday.
   ``They can change their itineraries without penalty,'' he said.
Airlines regularly prohibit reservation changes or charge for them
when passengers fly on the least-expensive fares.
   Meanwhile, Northwest reservations clerks were advising callers
of a ``security threat'' against the flight.
   Callers were told they could change reservations to another day
or another flight on a different airline.
   In a related incident, a USAir flight preparing to take off from
Philadelphia International Airport for Boston on Thursday returned
to the gate after a ``security threat'' was conveyed to the crew,
an airline spokesman said early today.
   The threat was found to be unfounded after security personnel
searched the cabin of Flight 528, USAir spokesman John Bronson
said. The 127 passengers on board the plane, scheduled to depart at
5:55 p.m., were returned to the gate, put up for the night and were
to be flown to Boston today.
