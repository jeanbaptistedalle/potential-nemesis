   Neil Kinnock, leader of the opposition Labor
Party, will meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow on Jan. 16, a party spokesman said Sunday.
   No details of the visit were available, said the spokesman,
speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
   He said Kinnock had a longstanding invitation from Gorbachev`and
that the trip would be ``short and businesslike.''
   Kinnock last visited Moscow in November 1984 for talks with
Konstantin Chernenko, who was the Soviet leader at that time.
