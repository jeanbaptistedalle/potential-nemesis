   Two Indians were beheaded Friday for
the murder of an Egyptian, the Interior Ministry said.
   Saudi Arabia is governed by Islamic law that prescribes
beheading for murder, the cutting off of a hand for theft and
stoning for adultery. In recent years the death penalty also has
been applied to drug smugglers.
   Executions of criminals convicted by Islamic courts are a common
occurrence on Fridays in Saudi Arabia. The beheadings are carried
out in public squares opposite mosques after Moslem Sabbath
congregational prayers.
   The announcement said the two Indians, whose names were given in
Arabic as Lingia Buhoma Bontor and Makla Kanka Malaya, fatally beat
the Egyptian Abdul-Hameed bin Mohammed bin Oweiss during a robbery
attempt.
   The crime, trial and beheadings took place in Najran, on the
western side of the desert kingdom.
