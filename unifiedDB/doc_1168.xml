<HEAD>EEC Approves Merger Control Law</HEAD>

   The 12 European Economic Community
nations on Thursday adopted a law that gives the EEC veto power
over large mergers within the trade bloc.
   Ministers of the Common Market countries granted the EEC's
administrative arm, the European Commission, authority over mergers
that currently rests with the governments of the 12 members.
   Under the new law, any proposed merger within the EEC that would
create a company with worldwide revenue of more than $5.85 billion
must be approved by the commission.
   The law also requires that the commission review a merger
creating a firm with revenue inside the EEC of more than $292.5
million.
   Transactions valued at amounts under the ceilings approved
Thursday would come under the jurisdiction of individual EEC
members.
   The law applies to mergers between two EEC companies as well as
to deals where only one company is an EEC firm.
   Before the law was passed, most large mergers were already being
submitted to the commission to ensure that proposed combinations
did not violate EEC competition rules.
   Under the law, the commission would be allowed to base its
judgment primarily on the effect a proposed merger would have on
competition within the EEC, a narrow standard pushed by Britain.
   In some cases, however, the commission will take into account
the effects of a merger on individual national markets.
   The vote ended 16 years of negotiations to bring mergers under
EEC control. The agreement was seen as a victory for the French
government, which currently holds the six-month rotating EEC
presidency and had set an agreement on the merger law as one of its
goals.
