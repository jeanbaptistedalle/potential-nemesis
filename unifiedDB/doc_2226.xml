   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest carmaker, is
considering moving part of its station wagon production unit to the
United States, company officials said Wednesday.
   The officials said Toyota plans to start production of its Camry
wagon at its U.S. carmaking unit, Toyota Motor Manufacturing U.S.A.
Inc., in Georgetown, Ky.
   Production at the U.S. plant is expected to start in early 1992,
but ``the schedule is subject to change depending on the market
situation,'' said a company official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   ``One of the reasons for moving the plant is that it is better
to manufacture where products will be sold,'' he said.
   Toyota currently sells Camry wagons only in overseas markets,
but it plans to import some of its U.S.-made wagons to Japan.
   Toyota has been selling about 1,600 Camry wagons a month in the
United States, but the official said they expect the demand to grow.
