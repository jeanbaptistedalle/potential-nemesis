<HEAD>El Paso Natural Gas Reaches $300 Million Settlement With Transamerican</HEAD>

   El Paso Natural Gas said Tuesday it will
pay Transamerican Natural Gas Corp. $300 million to settle a
lawsuit stemming from a gas purchase dispute involving jointly
owned properties in Texas.
   El Paso, a pipeline company owned by Burlington Resources Inc.,
said it will pay Houston-based Transamerican plus turn over oil and
gas mineral interests on the La Perla Ranch in Zapata County, which
El Paso estimated have a current market value of $90 million to
$110 million.
   The agreement settles a lawsuit filed by Transamerican over a
``take-or-pay'' contract with El Paso. Under such contracts,
purchasers agree to pay a supplier for natural gas, whether or not
they take immediate delivery.
   El Paso spokesman John McFall said a Houston jury ruled in favor
of Transamerican in April 1988. The initial judgment of $602
million plus attorney fees and court costs eventually was reduced
to $480 million.
   The agreement terminates all gas purchases and related
arrangements with Transamerican and requires the dismissal of
lawsuits now pending before a Texas state appellate court.
   El Paso said it expects the settlement to be implemented Jan. 31
after certain government clearances. The company said it will seek
to recover 75 percent of the settlement through its pipeline rates.
   Burlington Resources is the former energy unit of Burlington
Northern Inc., which was spun off as a separate company last year.
