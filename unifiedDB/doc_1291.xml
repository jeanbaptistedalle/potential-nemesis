   Word that the Salvation Army in this
economically troubled city would be closed for the rest of the
holiday season for lack of funds brought a flood of donations,
allowing the office to reopen, an official said today.
   ``The outpouring of the public has been marvelous,'' Maj. Robert
Pfeiffer, who runs the office, said this morning. Pfeiffer said
several thousand dollars was donated by corporations and
individuals after word of the closing went out.
   ``We are not turning anyone away,'' Pfeiffer said. ``The
Salvation Army is alive and well in New Bedford.''
   Pfeiffer announced Thursday that the office would close
indefinitely, saying a sharp increase in the number of people
seeking assistance was to blame.When the doors were closed at 2
p.m., there were still about 100 people waiting for help, he said.
   ``We've gone into using the canned food we had put aside for
January and February,'' Pfeiffer said Thursday.
   Pfeiffer blamed unemployment for bringing 1,600 families to the
office in the past year _ 300 more than last year. There have been
about 1,000 layoffs in the area in the last month, he said.
   The Salvation Army is a national religious and charitable
organization that is organized along military lines.
