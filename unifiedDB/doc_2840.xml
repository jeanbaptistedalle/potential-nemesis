   Police said Sunday that four
blacks were killed in recent violence in the townships outside
Durban, where more than 160 died in December in black-on-black
factional fighting.
   Two blacks were killed during a ``police action'' in Inanda,
where a group of men were setting homes on fire, the police unrest
report for the previous 24 hours said.
   A man was killed in a separate incident in Inanda when four huts
were set on fire, the report added.
   In nearby KwaMashu, police found the body of a man who had been
stabbed to death. Two unconscious men alongside him also had
suffered multiple stab wounds.
   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid
coalition, and Inkatha, a relatively conservative Zulu group, have
been battling since 1987 for political supremacy in the
southeastern province of Natal.
   An estimated 2,500 blacks have died, and December was the most
violent month yet in the townships surrounding the port city of
Durban, the most populous city in the province.
