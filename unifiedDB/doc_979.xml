<TEXT>
   Here is the text of a statement that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega made Wednesday night on a
government-run radio station. The communique was translated by The
Associated Press.
   This is Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega speaking to the Panamanian
people.
   We're in trench warfare now, and we will maintain the resistance.
   Congratulations to the Dignity Battalions. Congratulations to my
companions in arms and to the Defense Forces, and congratulations
to the Panamanian people.
   We must resist and advance. Our slogan: We ask the world for
help, with men, dignity, and strength. We ask the world for this
help today, for a Panama that needs it. Our slogan is to win or
die, not one step back, and onward in the step of conquerors.
