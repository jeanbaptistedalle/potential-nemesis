   State House Speaker James J. Manderino
collapsed and died at his home early Tuesday, just hours before his
plan to retire next year was to be announced, an aide said. He was
57.
   Manderino was stricken as he was getting out of bed at his home
in Monessen, 25 miles south of Pittsburgh, said an aide, Charles
Bacas. The cause of death was not immediately known.
   Bacas said he had planned to issue a statement Tuesday
announcing that Manderino would retire when his 12th House term
ended next December. Manderino had just completed his first year as
speaker after serving previously as Democratic leader.
   Manderino was known for his sharp tongue and his once-immense
stature. He weighed a reported 350 pounds before recently shedding
more than 100 pounds.
   A reporter for The Philadelphia Inquirer once said of him: ``As
a politician, he prefers vinegar to honey. Even his strongest
political supporters don't really like him. Even his most bitter
enemies respect him.''
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey issued a statement mourning the
loss of ``a true champion.''
   Manderino was ``a leader of extraordinary ability and a master
of the legislative process,'' Casey said. ``He was a strong ally of
this administration in working to enact programs to clean up our
environment and improve our economy.''
   Manderino, a lawyer, was first elected to the House in 1966.
   The House is scheduled to return for a token session Jan. 2 and
for a voting session Jan. 22. Under state law, Majority Leader
Robert O'Donnell, a Philadelphia Democrat, will serve as speaker
until a replacement is elected.
   Manderino is survived by five children, three sisters and one
brother.
