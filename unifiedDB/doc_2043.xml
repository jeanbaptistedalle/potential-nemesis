   A Jewish group erected a 40-foot menorah
outside the City-County Building, and the city said it was renewing
legal attempts to have the holiday symbol removed from public
property.
   The city planned to petition the U.S. Supreme Court today to
have the Hanukkah symbol taken down, attorneys said. The city
contends it has the right to determine what is permitted in front
of the building.
   The Orthodox Jewish Chabad group was permitted to erect the
display Monday under protection of a restraining order issued last
week by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
   Brennan upheld U.S. District Judge Barron P. McCune's order
preventing the city from blocking Chabad's installation of the
menorah.
   McCune ruled that the courthouse steps are a public forum open
to all types of expression.
   The eight-day Jewish Feast of Lights ends Saturday.
