<HEAD>Ag Department Announces Sign-up for New Soybean Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Farmers can sign up in a new ``0-25'' program
for 1990-crop soybeans Jan. 16 through Feb. 16, the Agriculture
Department said Friday.
   The program will enable farmers to plant soybeans on as much as
25 percent of their permitted acreages for 1990 wheat, feed grains,
cotton and rice. Sunflowers and safflowers also may be planted but
will not require a formal signup.
   If farmers choose to participate in the new program, the acreage
in soybeans will still be considered planted to the other
commodities for crop history purposes, said Dan Shaw, acting vice
president of the department's Commodity Credit Corp.
   Following the signup, the department will estimate how 1990
soybean prices may respond. If prices are indicated at less than
$4.98 per bushel _ 110 percent of the price support loan rate of
$4.53 _ the USDA ``will reduce or eliminate all or a portion'' of
the permitted acreage than can be planted to soybeans under the
program, he said.
   Producers can get further information from county offices of the
department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service,
Shaw said.
