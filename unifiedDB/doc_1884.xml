   Business executives, bank officers, attorneys, real
estate brokers and even car dealers have been drafted into the war
on drugs _ whether they like it or not.
   Armed with stiff new regulations passed under the Bank Secrecy
Act of 1988, the IRS and other federal agencies are forcing
businesses and financial institutions to help track the estimated
$220 million in profits generated daily by illegal drug sales in
this country.
   ``All that cash does no good stored in boxes. They have to turn
it around. That necessarily involves legitimate businesses,'' said
Miami lawyer Charles Intriago, who has started a publication that
promises to make sense of the regulatory maze and keep subscribers
on the right side of the law.
   ``The government has conscripted the entire business community
and required them to submit their paper trails,'' Intriago said.
``It's saying, `OK, you're in the war now _ play by the rules or
face severe penalties.'''
   Money Laundering Alert is an eight-page monthly newsletter of
advice, statistics and reports on what criminals do to hide the
source of their money and what government is doing to uncover their
schemes.
   As trade journals go, Alert has a sizeable niche, says Intriago,
a former chief counsel for the House committee that oversees all
banking regulatory agencies. He also has prosecuted white-collar
criminals and drug traffickers as an assistant U.S. attorney in
Miami.
   Amid growing calls for the legalization of drugs and evidence
that interdiction efforts have failed to reduce the cocaine flowing
into this country, money laundering controls have become the
government's weapon of choice, Intriago said.
   ``The money laundering initiative has a higher probability of
success than the others, such as interdiction. It hits the profit
motive,'' he said.
   Enlisting the help of banks and other often unwitting
handmaidens to drug traffickers has already yielded impressive
results.
   Days before billionaire Medellin cartel enforcer Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha was gunned down in Colombia on Dec. 15, U.S. and
Swiss officials traced his profits and were able to freeze $61.8
million of his assets in several countries.
   Under money laundering laws, banks are required to report large
cash transactions. Soon, the Treasury Department could also force
banks to put names and addresses on the estimated $1.25 trillion
transferred daily around the world on telephone lines. Details of
that initiative are laid out in Alert's November issue.
   These new money laundering laws are still in their infancy and
many have yet to be enforced. Many otherwise law-abiding businesses
may be unaware of the penalties they face, Intriago said.
   Alert costs $295 a year, but Intriago notes that the Treasury
Department can now impose $500 fines for every negligent error a
bank teller makes on one of the required forms.
   ``Tell me these institutions wouldn't like to receive a
publication that could spare them thousands of dollars in fines, to
say nothing of the bad publicity,'' Intriago said.
   With the fourth issue going to press, Alert has more than 200
subscribers, ranging from banks, thrifts and credit unions to
lawyers and accountants, foreign governments and diplomatic offices.
   Intriago doesn't mention ``drug kingpins'' on his list, and he
bristles at the suggestion that his newsletter could be as useful
to criminals as to law-abiding citizens.
   ``We don't do criminal background checks on our subscribers, nor
does The Wall Street Journal,'' he said. ``A number of criminal
defense attorneys have subscriptions, however.''
   One of those attorneys sits on the newsletter's editorial board
as well: Neal Sonnett of Miami, who represented Panamanian Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega when he was indicted on drug trafficking
charges in Florida.
   ``He's a very respected attorney,'' Intriago said, ``no matter
what his clientele is.''
