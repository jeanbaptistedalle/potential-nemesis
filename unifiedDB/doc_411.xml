   The dollar firmed against most major foreign
currencies in quiet European trading late this morning. Gold prices
also rose.
   Traders said movements were exaggerated in the thin
pre-Christmas market.
   ``In this market, small amounts are enough to move the dollar,''
said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``It's really Christmas that's fixing the market,'' said
another. ``Most people are staying out just to look.''
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the dollar staged a small technical
recovery overnight on rumors of imminent changes in key Japanese
interest rates. The rumors resulted in the selling of marks and
buying of yen, which firmed the dollar-mark rate, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 yen to a closing 143.80 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.90 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.7318 West German marks, up from 1.7245
   _1.5546 Swiss francs, up from 1.5480
   _5.9185 French francs, up from 5.8890
   _1.9533 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9455
   _1,292.00 Italian lire, up from 1,289.25
   _1.1610 Canadian dollars, unchanged
   In London, the dollar fell slightly against the British pound.
It cost $1.6038 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6020 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.90 a troy ounce, up
from $409.25 bid late Monday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $411.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $411.25, up from $408.50 bid late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong rose $1.83 to close at a bid $412.80.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.57 a troy ounce from
Monday's $5.55.
