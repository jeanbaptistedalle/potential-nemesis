<HEAD>Extradited Colombian Pleads Innocent to Cocaine Charges</HEAD>

   The 11th person extradited from Colombia to the
United States since its current crackdown against drug traffickers
began in August has pleaded innocent to drug charges.
   Victor Eduardo Mera-Mosquera, 36, a convicted cocaine smuggler,
was turned over to U.S. marshals by Colombian authorities on Sunday.
   Mera-Mosquera was mistakenly released from federal detention in
New York and fled to Colombia before his trial in 1984. He was
convicted in absentia of drug conspiracy and distribution, for
which he faces up to 30 years in prison.
   He also faces trial on a subsequent charge of running a
continuing drug enterprise, with a maximum penalty of life in
prison. He denied the charge Wednesday before U.S. District Judge
Morris Lasker, who ordered him held without bail.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Lee Warren said the government
would drop the new charge if Mera-Mosquera receives the 30-year
sentence he faces on his 1984 conviction. Colombia's extradition
treaty with the United States has a 30-year maximum on the terms
fugitives may face here.
   Mera-Mosquera was convicted of co-directing U.S. operations of a
ring that smuggled more than 2,200 pounds of cocaine, starting in
1982, according to his indictment. The new charge stems from the
same activities.
   Lasker did not set a sentencing date.
