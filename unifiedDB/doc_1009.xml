   The Panama Canal reopened Thursday
after a one-day closing caused by the U.S. invasion, the only time
anything other than natural disaster has halted operation of the
75-year-old waterway.
   The Panama Canal Commission said the canal will operate only
during the daytime until at least this weekend.
   Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon said only an average of
12 ships daily will travel the waterway, compared with a normal
average of about 33 a day when the canal operates its regular
round-the-clock schedule.
   The 43-mile canal had been closed since 1 a.m. Wednesday ``due
to the concern for the safety of vessels and of canal employees
during U.S. military activities in the area,'' the commission said
in a statement from the Washington office of the canal secretary,
Michael Rhode Jr.
   The commission said there has been no damage to canal facilities.
