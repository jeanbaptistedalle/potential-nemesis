   Police said they shot and killed a man
Tuesday who ignored an order to stop his motorcycle at a security
checkpoint during a relaxation in the curfew.
   Curfew was suspended for eight hours in Srinagar, the summer
capital of northern Jammu-Kashmir state, for the second time since
it was imposed Friday.
   Srinagar and four other towns were put under curfew after a
celebration by Moslem separatists turned violent. The separatists
were hailing the freedom of five of their jailed colleagues in a
ransom deal that resulted in the release of Home Minister Mufti
Mohammad Sayeed's kidnapped daughter, Rubaiya, 22.
   The motorcyclist was identified by police as Ghulam Hassan Raja.
   At least eight people now have died in violence arising from the
demonstrations.
