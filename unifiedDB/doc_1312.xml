   One homeless man stabbed another to death in a
subway station Friday, apparently to protect a turkey leg, transit
police said.
   Transit Authority police spokesman Al O'Leary said the incident
occurred as Vincent G. Williams, 59, was eating a turkey leg with a
knife in the waiting area of a station. The victim, another
homeless man whose identity was not immediately established, was
also in the waiting area.
   ``Although no words were exchanged, Mr. Williams perceived
somehow that the victim wanted his turkey leg, took the 10-inch
knife and stabbed the other man once in the heart,'' O'Leary said.
   A patrolling transit police officer came upon the scene and
arrested Williams. Formal charges were being determined.
   The knife was recovered.
