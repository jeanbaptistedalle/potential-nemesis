   A strong earthquake struck the Ungava Peninsula
of northern Quebec, Baffin Island and the eastern part of the
Northwest Territories on Christmas morning, but no damage or
injuries were reported.
   The quake, which occurred at 9:24 a.m. EST, measured 6.2 on the
Richter scale, said seismologist Robert North of the Ottawa office
of the Geological Survey of Canada.
   ``An earthquake over 6 points is a serious earthquake and can
cause severe damage in a populated area,'' North said.
   ``But fortunately the quake ... took place in a sparsely
populated area which has no large buildings, so the effects should
not cause any personal damage,'' he said.
   North said his office received a telephone call from the Inuit
village of Igloolik to report the quake. Iqaluit, on Frobisher Bay
in Baffin Island, also felt the temblor.
   Father Paul-Emile Tremblay, director of the Seismological
Observatory at Montreal's Jean de Brebeuf College, said the
epicenter was in the eastern part of the Northwest Territories and
the quake was felt within a 620-mile radius.
   ``We have been noticing low-level tremors in that area for some
time, so we were not surprised by the strong earthquake which
occurred on Christmas morning,'' he said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
