   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca
said Tuesday that 1990 could be the toughest year in a decade for
the auto industry, which already is hurting from declining sales
and temporary layoffs.
   Iacocca said in a year-end statement that 1989 sales of 9.8
million cars and 5.1 million trucks mark a return to a ``more
normal trend'' after four years of combined industry sales of 15.2
million to 16.3 million vehicles.
   He said sales estimates for 1990 of 9.5 million cars and 5
million light trucks are based largely on costly incentive programs
across the industry in an attempt to drum up buyers. Iacocca said
the industry has a production capacity of 22 million cars and
trucks.
   Iacocca said ``1990 is going to be even tougher, maybe the
toughest year the industry has faced in a decade.''
   Chrysler earlier this month launched a 45-day, $1,000 incentive
on its minivans. The incentive, which ends Jan. 31, was the
first-ever rebate on the automaker's popular minivans.
   The nation's Big Three automakers, Chrysler, General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co., last week announced temporary shutdowns
of many assembly lines in January.
   Sales are expected to return to years-earlier levels because of
decreased demand as people worried about the nation's economy
postpone buying, Chrysler spokesman John McCandless said.
   But he added that the projected total of 14.5 million cars and
trucks would be a ``pretty good year.''
   Iacocca also said Chrysler's $1 billion cost-cutting program
announced earlier this year and attempts to develop new technology
are aimed at keeping the No. 3 automaker competitive.
