   Survivors of a Christmas Eve sea
accident in the southern Philippines claimed Tuesday they were
attacked by a giant octopus that overturned their motorized canoe.
   Fishermen on Monday found 12 survivors clinging to the
overturned craft and recovered the body of a two-week-old boy off
Manticao, 17 miles from where the accident took place.
   All the survivors suffered from severe sunburn but none was
seriously hurt, said Manticao police Cpl. Samuel Cabasan.
   The Philippine Navy and Coast Guard headquarters in Manila said
they had not received any report about the sinking in Iligan Bay,
about 490 miles southeast of the capital.
   ``Suddenly, the waters began to bubble,'' said survivor Agapito
Caballero. ``Then with the use of flashlights, we saw something
that looked like a giant octopus. It was as huge as an imported
cow.''
   Caballero's brother, Alfredo, whose baby boy died, said the
octopus grabbed the vessel's pontoons and overturned it. But the
octopus submerged after the attack and did not harm them, he added.
   Manila newspapers said two other passengers of the 15 who were
on the boat were found Monday. They quoted Eleuterio Sarino, the
boat owner, as saying the boat was submerged by huge waves. He did
not mention the octopus.
