   Here is a brief summary of events Sunday:
   _Gen. Maxwell Thurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, said
he had a report that ousted dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
turned himself in to the papal representative in Panama and asked
for political asylum.
   _Earlier, four of Noriega's top commanders surrendered to U.S.
soldiers.
   _Fighting tapered off, with some Panamanians trying to clean up
streets and put up Christmas decorations.
   _The U.S.-backed president, Guillermo Endara, said he hoped the
Americans would be able to leave soon, but that he wasn't
optimistic.
   _U.S. troops discovered a huge cache of arms in a rented house
near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of
Panama City. Neighbors who tipped off the military said the house
had been rented by Noriega.
   _In Washington, President Bush said the U.S. troops have
accomplished ``a real turnaround'' in restoring law and order in
Panama.
