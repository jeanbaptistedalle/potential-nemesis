   U.S. troops prevented a man from
entering the Cuban ambassador's residence Thursday because he
wasn't carrying the proper diplomatic credentials, a U.S. embassy
spokesman said.
   The man was riding with Cuban Ambassador Lazaro Mora when the
two were stopped for inspection by U.S. forces that have surrounded
the embassy, said U.S. spokesman William Barr.
   Mora had his credentials and identified the other man as his
first secretary, said Barr, but the other man didn't have his
credentials.
   After a brief conversation with U.S. troops, the two men drove
off to get the other man's credentials, Barr said.
   ``He was never detained,'' Barr said of the ambassador.
   The Cuban embassy residence has been surrounded since Dec. 20 by
U.S. troops to prevent Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or his henchmen
from entering or leaving the grounds.
   Earlier, the ambassador's wife told The Associated Press her
husband had been taken away in a U.S. armored car. In a telephone
interview, Maria Elena de Mora said her husband, his personal
secretary and the embassy's commercial attache were involved in the
incident.
