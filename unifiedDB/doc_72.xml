   Gov. Rose Mofford entered a hospital Sunday after
complaining of chest pains, a spokesman said.
   The 67-year-old Democrat entered St. Joseph's Hospital and
Medical Center about 3 p.m., said Vada Manager, Mrs. Mofford's
press aide.
   The hospital did not immediately issue a report on Mrs.
Mofford's condition, but Manager said a preliminary check indicated
a gall bladder problem.
   ``She did not have a heart attack,'' he said.
   Further tests were expected, and the governor was prepared to
remain hospitalized until Monday, Manager said.
   The voluntary hospitalization came after one of Mrs. Mofford's
most difficult weeks in office.
   On Dec. 9, she apologized for commuting the prison terms of two
convicted murderers and said she would like to rescind the
commutation because the victims' families had not been notified in
advance. Some political observers criticized her apparently
contradictory statements about her intentions.
   On Friday, she agreed with a legal opinion from Attorney General
Bob Corbin, who said the commutations were void due to a
technicality.
   In the same week, Mrs. Mofford was blasted by Arizona's
primarily Democratic labor leaders for lauding an anti-union
organization for ``excellence in the field of employee relations.''
   Mrs. Mofford began complaining of chest pains Saturday while
visiting the Grand Canyon gateway cities of Flagstaff and Williams,
Manager said.
   He said Sunday night that the pains had eased.
   Mrs. Mofford, Arizona's first woman governor and the former
secretary of state, succeeded Republican Evan Mecham in April 1988
when the state Senate convicted him on two articles of impeachment.
