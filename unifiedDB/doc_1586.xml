   Here is a brief summary of events Saturday in Panama:
   _2,000 U.S. soldiers arrived to reinforce the 24,000 American
soldiers already in Panama. Troops met unexpectedly stiff
resistance by forces loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   _Panama's President Guillermo Endara named a Cabinet but
declined to reveal their names because the security situation was
so serious.
   _U.S. authorities said they had seized more than 13,000 weapons.
   _Panama's bishops conference urged that ``the U.S. military
action end as soon as possible.''
   _Nicaraguan troops surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Managua again
in an effort to force U.S. soldiers searching for Noriega to end
their blockade of Nicaragua's Embassy in Panama. U.S. troops
continued to surround the Nicaraguan, Cuban and Libyan embassies in
Panama City.
   _U.S. authorities said prisoners at an island penitentiary in
the Pacific apparently overcame their pro-Noriega guards and
radioed for help from American forces. The prison group was said to
include some of the former Panamanian officers who led a failed
coup Oct. 3.
   _The Pentagon said 24 American soldiers and 139 Panamanian
soldiers have been killed. It reported 222 Americans and 95
Panamanians wounded, and two American soldiers and one civilian
missing. Two civilian U.S. dependents were killed and 1,663
Panamanians detained.
