   Susan Atkins, the Charles Manson
``family'' member who fatally stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate
20 years ago, has been denied parole for the ninth time.
   Fellow Manson disciple Leslie Van Houten was scheduled for a
parole hearing this morning.
   The victim's mother argued Wednesday against Ms. Atkins' release.
   ``I don't understand why anyone would murder an innocent
pregnant woman,'' Doris Tate told the three-member parole board.
``The thing that goes continually through my mind is the lack of
compassion Susan had for Sharon.''
   In rejecting her bid for release, the state parole board noted
Ms. Atkins had a role in eight murders ``for the bizarre motive of
starting a race war.''
   Ms. Atkins, 41, is serving a life sentence for murders that
included the 1969 slayings of Miss Tate and of grocer Leno LaBianca
and his wife the following night. Ms. Atkins won't get another
parole hearing until 1992.
   Neither Manson nor anyone else directly involved in the Tate or
LaBianca murders has been granted parole.
