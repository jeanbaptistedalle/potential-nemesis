   Long County, known as one of the Georgia
coast's great speed traps, became a goodwill trap for a day.
   Motorists got a firm handshake, a bag of fruit and an invitation
to return _ instead of a ticket. The project was the brainchild of
Danny Norman, chairman of the Long County Commission.
   Norman, Sheriff Cecil Nobles and off-duty Deputy Fred Williamson
made up the welcoming delegation. They had about a dozen large bags
of fruit to give away, and spent the afternoon waiting along U.S.
301 and U.S. 82 until they spotted a license plate from another
state.
   With blue lights flashing, they'd take up the chase.
   Norman said the idea would go a long way toward overcoming the
national notoriety as a speed trap that the county once possessed.
   ``You don't understand how much good, as small a thing as this
is, can do,'' Norman said. ``Multiply the number of people in the
car by 250, and you'll see what kind of positive impact you can
have with a bag of fruit.''
   One car they pulled over carried Arthur and Mildred Green of
Inglewood, Fla., who were en route to Dayton, Ohio. Norman told
them:
   ``Tell all your folks, and everyone you see, we want folks
coming through Long County.''
   Nobles suggested that the Greens ``come back and see us.''
   ``Thank you for everything,'' Green responded.
