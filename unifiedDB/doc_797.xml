   A Louisiana processor is voluntarily recalling
about 1,000 pounds of a frozen pork and rice product because it
might be contaminated with a food-poisoning organism, Listeria
monocytogenes, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Bodin Foods Inc. of New Iberia, La., sells the product through
small distributors in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and
Texas.
   It is sold frozen in vacuum-sealed plastic packages with the
name ``Boo Dan (Boudin Link) Traditional Cajun Pudding'' on the
label, and ``Est. 8214'' printed inside the USDA inspection seal on
the label.
   A USDA spokesman said the product is cooked pork and rice
wrapped in a sausage casing, or link.
   Each 10-ounce package sold in grocery stores contains two links
and is shipped 12 per carton. Ten-pound bulk packages sold to
restaurants and delicatessens contain approximately 30 links.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said consumers ``should not unwrap or taste the
product'' and should return it to where it was purchased.
   Crawford said the Centers for Disease Control confirmed the
presence of Listeria monocytogenes while investigating a case of
listeriosis, the disease caused by the organism.
   Listeriosis was described as ``a rare but potentially serious''
disease. Most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems,
including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill.
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache, and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea. In newborns, symptoms include respiratory
distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.
   Consumers with question about the recall may phone the toll-free
USDA meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555 between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. Callers in the Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area may call 447-3333.
