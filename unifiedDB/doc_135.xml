   A man driving a stolen pickup truck
slammed into a farmer's market and killed two people who were
shopping for a Christmas tree, authorities said.
   Brake Wade, 15, of Collinsville was pronounced dead of internal
injuries at Anderson Hospital in Maryville shortly after the
accident Sunday evening, said Madison County Coroner Dallas Burke.
   Roland Cox, 37, of Pontoon Beach died in surgery several hours
later, Burke said.
   The 30-year-old driver, who was not injured, was being held in
the Collinsville City Jail pending felony charges of reckless
homicide and possession of a stolen vehicle, said David Niebur, the
city's police chief. Collinsville is in southwest Illinois.
   The driver's name was not immediately released. Police were
investigating whether alcohol was a factor in the accident. Niebur
said the pickup truck had been stolen earlier in the day from
nearby Belleville.
