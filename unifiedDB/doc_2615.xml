   Alexander Ellis II, brother-in-law of President
Bush and a prominent businessman, died Friday of a stroke. He was
67 years old.
   Ellis was married to Nancy Walker Bush Ellis, sister of the
president. He had been hospitalized for the past two weeks at
Massachusetts General Hospital and had undergone an intestinal
operation Monday, said his son, Alexander III.
   President Bush was ``very close to the family. He has been in
touch constantly through this two and a half weeks,'' Alexander III
said.
   Ellis was born April 9, 1922, in Cambridge, son of Alexander
Ellis, the founder of Fairfield and Elllis, an insurance brokerage.
   He attended Yale University and served as a lieutenant in the
82nd Airborne Division in Europe during World War II. He was
wounded during the Battle of the Bulge.
   He married Nancy Bush in 1946. He joined his father's firm and
became president during the late 1960s and chief executive officer
in 1975.
   Ellis was active in state Republican politics, serving as a
state committeeman and a delegate to the 1964 Republican
convention. He also served on the board of the YMCA and an overseer
for Massachusetts General Hospital.
   In 1986, he sold Fairfield and Ellis to Carroon and Black, a New
York-based insurance brokerage, but remained as chairman of the
company's Boston office and was active in the business until his
recent hospitalization.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Alexander
Ellis III, John Prescott Ellis and Josiah Wear Ellis; a daughter,
Nancy Walker Ellis Black; and four grandchildren.
   The funeral is scheduled Tuesday morning, the family said.
