   McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Business Week magazine plans
to publish a new magazine designed for wealthy people twice a year
starting in 1990, said Business Week publisher John W. Patten.
   The new magazine will be called Assets, and it will be sent for
free to 400,000 to 500,000 people, many of whom already subscribe
to Business Week, Patten said in a statement Monday. Business
Week's worldwide circulation exceeds 1 million.
   Business Week editor-in-chief Stephen B. Shepard said the new
magazine will deal with ``personal finance and executive living''
and will be about ``people and ideas as well as products and
investments.''
   The first issue will be a companion to Business Week's bonus
issue called ``Innovation'' that is to be published in June, while
the second will be published with the ``Corporate Elite'' issue of
Business Week in the fall.
   Assets will be a stand-alone magazine separate from those issues
of Business Week, but will not be available on newstands,
spokeswoman Christine Summerson said.
   In a statement, Patten said Assets ``will not just be another
magazine with fluff articles about how the other half lives.''
   ``It is for and about people who are reaching a time in life
when they are facing new challenges, both personal and financial,''
he said.
