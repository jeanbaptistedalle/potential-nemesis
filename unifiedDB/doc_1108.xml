   A pilot attempting to make an emergency
landing on an interstate highway landed instead on the back of a
moving semi-trailer truck, the state patrol said Thursday.
   There were no injuries in the incident, which happened around 9
p.m. Wednesday on Interstate 94 about four miles west of Rothsay in
west-central Minnesota, said highway patrol spokeswoman Roxanne
Ingum.
   Ingum said the single-engine Cessna piloted by Robert Russell of
Cottage Grove was en route from the Twin Cites to Grand Forks,
N.D., when the plane's engine apparently iced up.
   Ingum said Russell attempted an emergency landing on Interstate
94, but the plane touched down on a grain truck westbound on the
freeway, then slid off the truck into the center median.
   Russell and passenger Brad Schirmers of St. Louis Park, both
attending the University of North Dakota Flight Schol, were unhurt
and Ingum said the truck driver was described as shaken but also
escaped injury.
   Federal aviation officials are investigating the accident.
