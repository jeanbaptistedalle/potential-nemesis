   Fire swept through a psychiatric clinic
in a working class neighborhood early Wednesday, killing five
inmates, the hospital said.
   The fire, which started around 4 a.m., apparently was started by
one of the inmates, said Dr. Juan Cortes, director of the hospital.
   Thirty other inmates were rescued unharmed, he said.
   Authorities have opened an investigation.
