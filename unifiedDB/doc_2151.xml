   A court on Wednesday ordered two major publishers
to pay $22,400 in damages for defaming Japan's first female AIDS
victim by publishing her photograph in their weekly magazines after
she died, one of the publishers said.
   The Osaka District Court ordered Kobunsha Co. and Shinchosha to
pay the damages, according to a Kobunsha official. The official
declined to discuss further details, including whether the
companies would appeal to a higher court.
   Japan's first female AIDS patient died at the age of 29 on Jan.
20, 1987. The Health and Welfare Ministry, which did not identify
the patient, listed sexual contact as the cause of her infection.
   Kyodo News Service quoted presiding Judge Yutaka Tahata as
saying in his verdict that Shinchosha's Focus magazine and
Kobunsha's Flash had defamed the woman by carrying her picture and
``groundless'' stories that invaded her privacy and harmed her
parents' respect and affection for her.
   Kyodo said the parents had filed their libel suit in September
1987 demanding $140,000 in damages.
   As of April 10, 1989, 103 people in Japan had contracted AIDS,
or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, according to Health and
Welfare Ministry figures.
   AIDS attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most
often transmitted through sexual contact, transfusions of tainted
blood and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles by drug
abusers.
