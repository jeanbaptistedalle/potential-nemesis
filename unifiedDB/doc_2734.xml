   Ten anti-abortion activists were arrested
inside a women's health clinic after they got inside by posing as
clients and then urged women to forgo abortions.
   Seven other supporters of the anti-abortion group Operation
Rescue were arrested while demonstrating outside the Northside
Women's Clinic Friday, police said.
   The protesters entered the clinic with a group of clients,
police said. After everyone was seated, the men jumped up and began
arguing against abortion.
   Police advised clinic employees to check the day's client list,
and arrested those who didn't have appointments.
   Outside, other protesters sat in front of two clinic entrances.
A group sang and picketed in front of the clinic, briefly blocking
cars until the occupants rolled down their windows and accepted
anti-abortion literature. One man was arrested after he stood in
front of a car and refused to move.
   Chamblee Police Chief Reed Miller said those arrested, 16 adults
and one 16-year-old girl, were charged with criminal trespass and
were held on $220 bond each at the DeKalb County Jail.
   Miller said he normally releases abortion protesters after
giving them a copy of the charges, but ``I feel like it's more
serious this time.''
   ``They were actually inside the building,'' he said. ``Something
bad is going to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if one day this
thing blew sky-high.''
   Friday's demonstration was the third time this month that
members of the group have been arrested in the Atlanta area and the
second time the Northside Clinic has been targeted.
