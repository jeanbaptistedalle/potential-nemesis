   Two gunmen posed as customers before robbing
a jewelry district wholesaler of more than 100 pounds of scrap gold
and gold products worth about $1 million, police said.
   The two owners and five employees were tied up in the robbery
Wednesday at the Rope Mine Corp.
   At least 103 pounds of fine gold, gold chains, locks and scrap
bars were stolen from an open safe in the offices of the downtown
jewelry district company, said Khatchik Djigardjian, who owns the
wholesale business with his brother, Liouduig.
   ``It's a pretty good-size robbery,'' said Detective Manny
Garcia, who estimated the haul at 115 pounds of gold.
   Djigardjian said the robbers pressed the door buzzer about 8
a.m. and were in his sixth-floor office. There was momentary
business talk, and the men said they were from New York.
Djigardjian said he was then suddenly held at gunpoint and never
made a move for the unloaded shotgun propped against his desk or
the loaded gun in his desk drawer.
   The men handcuffed him in his office, he said, and the employees
were called in singly, then tied up. Wearing surgical gloves, the
robbers put the gold in a briefcase and fled. Two of the bound
employees were able to wrest a phone from a desk and call for help.
   The exact loss would have to be determined by an inventory but
was ``close to a million dollars if not more than that,''
Djigardjian said.
   The detectives' report said both robbers may have been Middle
Eastern and both were armed with handguns.
