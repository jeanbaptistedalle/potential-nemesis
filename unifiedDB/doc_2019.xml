   Landmark Ventures Inc. said Tuesday it
would acquire a portfolio of 54 venture capital partnerships from
Cigna Venture Capital Inc. for more than $100 million.
   The partnerships have 1,200 investments in nearly 800 companies,
Landmark said.
   Simsbury-based Landmark, previously known as Technology
Transitions Inc., manages about $60 million in a portfolio of 25
technology-based growth companies covering computer-based systems,
software and support services, advanced electronics and medical and
scientific instrumentation.
   The Cigna portfolio ranges from investments in biomedical
research and electronic technology to services and leveraged
buyouts of mature enterprises.
   Cigna Venture Capital is a subsidiary of Philadelphia-based
Cigna Corp. It also succeeded venture capital investing activities
of six Cigna life, property and casualty insurance subsidiaries.
   The agreement does not include Cigna Venture Capital's direct
investments in some private companies or interests in six other
limited partnerships, which Cigna will retain.
   Cigna said it was withdrawing from the venture capital field to
concentrate on traditional investments in long-term mortgages,
private placements and leveraged buyouts.
