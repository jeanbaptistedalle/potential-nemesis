   Two sightseeing planes collided
off southern New Zealand today and one crashed in water, killing
seven people on board, according to news reports.
   The New Zealand Press Association said the dead included six
Japanese tourists and their New Zealand pilot.
   The agency, quoting a report on Televison New Zealand, said the
pilot of the other plane landed safely at Milford, on the southwest
corner of the South Island.
   It did not mention other passengers or give details of the
collision.
   ``The light aircraft operated by Air Fiordland crashed into the
deepest part of Milford Sound in the Stirling Falls area and is
irrecoverable at this stage,'' Constable Alan Christie of the
Queenstown Police was quoted as saying.
   He said the plane was lying in approximately 1,000 feet of
water. The press association said only two of the bodies had been
recovered.
