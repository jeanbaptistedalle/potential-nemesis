<HEAD>Sears Forms ESOP, Expanding Workers' Stake to 21 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced an
employee stock ownership plan that will buy up to $800 million
worth of Sears common stock, expanding employee ownership of the
company to 21 percent from 15 percent.
   The ESOP will provide a cheaper way for the Chicago-based
retailing and financial-services company to fund its profit-sharing
program since it can deduct from its taxes dividends paid on the
ESOP shares, said Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather.
   The ESOP will buy the shares _ which would number 21.8 million
at Wednesday's closing price of $36.62{ _ over the next several
months with money loaned by the company.
   The loan will be repaid over the next 15 years from dividends on
the ESOP shares and future contributions to the profit-sharing
plan, Fairweather said.
   In a prepared statement, Sears Chairman Edward Brennan said the
``increased ownership of Sears shares reinforces our employees'
commitment to Sears' success.''
