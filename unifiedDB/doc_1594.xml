   The hockey mask worn by masked movie murderer
Jason in the horror film ``Friday the 13th'' and stolen from
director John Waters' porch was found in a mailbox after police
received a tip Saturday.
   Waters didn't direct Friday the 13th, but was given the mask by
Nick Mancuso, the executive producer of the horror film. The mask
was taken last week from the front porch of Waters' home, where a
deliveryman had left it.
   Waters, who directed cult movie hits such as ``Hairspray'' that
featured the late female impersonator Divine, had planned to give
the hockey mask to an old friend for Christmas.
   An anonymous caller phoned police Saturday, and said a
``precious item'' was in a mailbox in north Baltimore. The mailbox
was opened and the missing mask was found in a brown paper bag
addressed to Waters, police said.
   ``I asked him what kind of `precious item' and he said it was
the John Waters mask,'' police officer Julie Morgan said.
