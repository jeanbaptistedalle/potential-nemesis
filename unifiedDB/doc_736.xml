   A naked man tried to force his way
into the U.S. ambassador's residence and was shot and wounded in a
struggle with an armed guard, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday.
   The incident Tuesday apparently was not politically motivated
and the intruder may have been under the influence of drugs, the
U.S. Embassy said.
   The man, identified by police as a Frenchman born in Senegal,
climbed the fence at the ambassador's house after he was told he
could not enter, and a struggle with a security officer ensued, the
embassy said.
   The intruder tried to grab the guard's gun, and was shot in the
leg, the embassy said. The man was handed over to police, where he
remained in custody.
   Police said the incident began when the man got into an argument
with a West German companion, stripped off his clothes and ran
through the streets.
   He tried unsuccessfully to rob an elderly woman, and then
climbed the embassy fence, police said.
   Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador, was not home at the
time, the embassy said.
