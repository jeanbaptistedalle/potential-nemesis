   A former head of security for Unisys Corp.
was charged Friday with manipulating payroll records, leading the
company to overcharge the federal government $70,732.
   Joseph Schulz, 60, of Richboro, was charged with causing false
statements to be made to the Department of Defense from September
1986 to September 1988.
   During that time, Schulz was employed as a guard captain for
National Guardian Security Services, which provided security to
Unisys on government contract work, according to U.S. Attorney
Michael Baylson.
   Schulz was responsible for scheduling and supervising guards at
Unisys.
   According to the charges, Schulz manipulated payroll records to
show that more security guards were on duty than actually worked,
resulting in Unisys sending false invoices to the Defense
Department for payment.
   If convicted, Schulz faces a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine, according to Baylson.
   No one answered at a phone listed in Schulz's name to comment on
the charge Friday night.
