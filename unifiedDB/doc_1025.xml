   An earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale occurred today near McGrath, Alaska, the U.S. Geological
Survey reported.
   The epicenter was about 30 miles southeast of McGrath, and the
quake was felt strongly in the McGrath area, according to the
survey. Numerous quakes have occurred in this region in the past,
it said.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injury, the survey
said.
   The quake occurred at 7:53 a.m. Alaska Standard Time (1:53 p.m.
EST), the survey said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 isa ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
