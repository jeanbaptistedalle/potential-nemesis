   Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG are discussing a
European joint venture to produce multipurpose vehicles, but Ford
is releasing few details about it.
   Ford spokeswoman Lin Cummins said Monday the two companies were
involved in talks about ``a possible European cooperation in a
specific product segment.'' She refused to elaborate.
   Tom McDonald, a spokesman for Volkswagen's U.S. subsidiary,
Volkswagen of America Inc., said he knew nothing of European talks
between his parent company and Ford.
   The collaboration would be the latest in a string of joint
ventures proposed by automakers to take advantage of the emerging
unified European market.
   Monday's editions of Financial Times said in a story from London
the two companies were discussing a minivan project aimed at
mid-1990s production.
   Ford and Volkswagen are involved in Autolatina, a company that
develops, manufactures and distributes cars and commercial vehicles
in South America.
   Ford and Nissan Motor Corp. plan to begin joint production of a
minivan at Ford's truck plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, in the fall of
1991.
